The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air.

Barium enema is the most likely diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. The barium enema will show a transition zone between the dilated and non-dilated colon, which indicates the presence of aganglionic bowel.\n\nThe other options listed are not as likely to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. CT scan of the abdomen and transabdominal ultrasonography may show signs of bowel obstruction, but they are not the most specific tests for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. Anorectal manometry and rectal suction biopsy may be used for the definitive diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease, but in this case, the barium enema is the more appropriate initial diagnostic test."}

The description of the patient becoming diaphoretic, pale, and passing out while being tattooed on her right upper flank is consistent with a vasovagal response. Additionally, the jerky movements of the arms and legs immediately after losing consciousness are also typical of vasovagal syncope.\n\nThe patient's history of increased stress due to her recent concert tour may have contributed to her vasovagal response. The normal vital signs, absence of abnormalities on cardiopulmonary and neurologic examination, and the presence of an incomplete right bundle branch block on ECG make it less likely that the episode was due to a cardiac arrhythmia or structural abnormality.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's history and the clinical presentation, vasovagal syncope is the most likely diagnosis."}

This condition is characterized by inflammation and damage to the renal tubules and interstitium, often due to long-term use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This can lead to impaired renal function, as evidenced by the deterioration in renal function and the presence of proteinuria on urinalysis.\n\nWhile other conditions such as ischemic acute tubular necrosis, nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are also possible causes of renal function deterioration, the patient's history and biopsy findings strongly suggest toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis as the most likely explanation."}

By inhibiting these enzymes, miglitol delays the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, leading to a slower rise in blood glucose levels after meals.\n\nPhosphodiester bonds are involved in DNA and RNA structure, so they are not affected by miglitol. Peptide bonds are involved in protein structure, and cystine bonds are a type of disulfide bond found in protein structure, so they are also not affected by miglitol. Hydrogen bonds are also not affected by miglitol as they are important for various molecular interactions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Glycosidic bonds, as these are the bonds that will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol."}

Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nA: Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes\nB: DNA test for CFTR mutation\nC: Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test\nD: Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes\nE: T-cell receptor excision circle analysis\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes", "predict_answer": "The most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms described is infantile HIV infection. The presence of oral thrush (white plaques on the tongue and palate), history of multiple watery stools, failure to thrive, and signs of respiratory distress (rales heard bilaterally) are suggestive of an immunocompromised state, which is commonly seen in HIV-infected infants.\n\nThe most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of infantile HIV infection in this case would be D: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral genes. PCR testing for HIV DNA or RNA is the most reliable method for diagnosing HIV infection in infants less than 18 months old, as serologic tests may yield false-positive results due to passive transfer of maternal antibodies. PCR testing can detect the presence of viral genetic material in the infant's bloodstream, confirming the diagnosis of HIV infection.\n\nKaryotyping of the infant's chromosomes (option A) would not be the most appropriate initial test, as the clinical presentation and findings are more suggestive of an infectious etiology rather than a genetic disorder. DNA testing for CFTR mutation (option B) and T-cell receptor excision circle analysis (option E) are not indicated in this case, as they are not specific for diagnosing HIV infection. The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (option C) is used to diagnose syphilis, but there are no clinical findings suggestive of syphilis in this case.\n\nIn summary, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of infantile HIV infection in this 3-month-old girl is PCR for viral genes."}

Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?\nA: Drug-induced hypokalemia\nB: Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin\nC: Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme\nD: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\nE: Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Drug-induced hypokalemia.\n\nThe development of digoxin toxicity in this patient is most likely due to drug-induced hypokalemia. Digoxin toxicity is known to be potentiated by hypokalemia, and the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness are consistent with digoxin toxicity.\n\nLow-dose aspirin, verapamil, and digoxin are all known to cause hypokalemia. Aspirin can increase renal excretion of potassium, verapamil can cause gastrointestinal potassium loss, and digoxin itself can lead to hypokalemia. The combination of these medications may have led to the development of hypokalemia, which in turn has potentiated the toxic effects of digoxin.\n\nGiven the patient's history of heart failure, he may also be at increased risk for developing hypokalemia due to the use of diuretics, which can lead to potassium loss.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism of development of digitalis toxicity in this patient is drug-induced hypokalemia."}

In liver histology, the liver lobule is divided into three zones: periportal, centrilobular, and midlobular. The centrilobular zone (zone 3) of the liver lobule is the area farthest from the portal triads and is the last area to receive oxygenated blood. This makes it the most vulnerable to ischemia or hypoxia. \n\nIn this patient, the significant drop in blood pressure, likely due to diverticular bleeding, led to hypoperfusion of the liver, causing damage to the centrilobular hepatocytes. This is further supported by the elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine, indicating pre-renal azotemia due to hypoperfusion. Therefore, the centrilobular hepatocytes were most likely damaged first."}

One of the common cardiac complications of hyperthyroidism is atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm, as seen in the electrocardiogram.\n\nDigoxin is a medication used to control the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. It works by slowing down the conduction of electrical impulses in the heart, which is beneficial in controlling the rapid heart rate experienced in atrial fibrillation. Therefore, in a patient with atrial fibrillation, digoxin blood levels would have a strong positive correlation with the patient’s heart rhythm. Monitoring digoxin levels is essential to ensure that the medication is at a therapeutic level and not contributing to any potential toxicity, especially in a patient with other medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."}

This can include techniques such as gradual exposure to dogs in a controlled and safe environment, as well as teaching coping skills to manage anxiety and fear.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and short-acting benzodiazepines may provide short-term relief of anxiety symptoms, but they do not address the underlying root cause of the phobia. Systematic desensitization, which is a type of exposure therapy, is a component of CBT and could be a part of the treatment plan. Dialectical behavioral therapy is not typically used as the first-line treatment for specific phobias like the fear of dogs."}

The presenting symptoms include severe pain, decreased sensation, inability to move the affected limb, absence of pulses, and pallor and coolness of the limb. The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg is significantly elevated and indicates the need for immediate intervention.\n\nVenous doppler would not be the next best step as this patient's symptoms are indicative of arterial insufficiency, not venous issues. Arteriogram may be helpful in identifying the site and extent of arterial injury, but in the acute setting, the priority is to relieve the compartment pressure and restore arterial blood flow. External or internal fixation may be indicated for associated fractures, but the immediate concern is the acute compartment syndrome. Therefore, emergent fasciotomy is the next best step in this patient's care."}

It is particularly effective in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) who have concomitant asthma. \n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an exacerbation of COPD. Although supplemental oxygen is necessary for managing his acute respiratory failure, it is not a medication that will reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations. Oral theophylline and nebulized N-acetylcysteine are also not considered first-line medications for the prevention of COPD exacerbations. Oral prednisone may be used during exacerbations to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms, but it is not typically used for long-term prevention of exacerbations due to its potential for significant side effects when used for a prolonged period.\n\nMontelukast, on the other hand, is a specific medication indicated for the reduction of COPD exacerbations when added to the patient's current regimen of inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone propionate.

Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?\nA: Alanine\nB: Adenosine diphosphate\nC: Adenosine monophosphate\nD: Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate\nE: Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "A: Alanine", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is D: Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.\n\nThe infant's presentation with normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin is consistent with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA), which is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed prematurely. The enzyme deficiency in this case is likely to be pyruvate kinase, which is involved in the glycolytic pathway. The deficiency leads to a decrease in ATP production and an increase in 2,3-DPG, which leads to decreased erythrocyte deformability and increased hemolysis.\n\nFructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate kinase.

TSS is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of a bacterial infection, often associated with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. One common trigger for TSS is the use of tampons, but in this case, the patient's symptoms are more likely related to a recent treatment with sulfonamides, as TSS can also be caused by certain medications. Additionally, the patient's history does not suggest exposure to a patient with meningococcemia, intravenous heroin abuse, or a recent hiking trip as potential triggers for TSS.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, recent treatment with sulfonamides is the most likely cause of her symptoms."}

The antibodies produced by the mother can cross the placenta and affect the thyroid function of the fetus. In this case, the near-total thyroidectomy of the mother during pregnancy and the need for L-thyroxine therapy suggest that her thyroid function was not well controlled, increasing the likelihood of transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies to the fetus.\n\nThe symptoms exhibited by the infant, such as poor weight gain, irritability, tachycardia, and swelling of the neck at the midline (consistent with a goiter), are all indicative of hyperthyroidism, which can result from the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the infant's symptoms and poor weight gain is the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies."}

The calcaneus is an important bone in the foot that helps with plantar flexion (pointing the foot downward). With stable lumbar fractures, there may also be some limitations in overall mobility and strength. As a result, it is likely that the patient will have difficulty with plantar flexion due to the nature of his injuries and the surgical repair. This can lead to long-term limitations in movement and function. Therefore, option A is the best description of the long-term post-surgery outcome in this patient."}

Pulmonary embolism should be considered in any postoperative patient with chest pain, shortness of breath, or unexplained fever.\n\nB: Subphrenic abscess is less likely given the absence of localized abdominal tenderness and the softness of the abdomen.\n\nC: Pneumonia is less likely as the symptoms, including the right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and the presence of crackles, are more suggestive of pulmonary embolism.\n\nD: Atelectasis is less likely as it usually presents with decreased breath sounds and does not typically cause fever, chills, and headache.\n\nE: Pneumothorax is less likely as it usually presents with sudden onset of sharp chest pain and dyspnea, and the symptoms are not typically associated with fever, chills, and headache.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pulmonary embolism (A)."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?\nA: Lack of a comparison group\nB: No prevalence assessment\nC: Low number of patients\nD: Ascertainment bias\nE: Lack of risk calculation\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Lack of risk calculation", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is C: Low number of patients. The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study likely because the sample size of 14 patients is considered small for a cohort study. In a cohort study, a larger sample size is typically required to adequately assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of a particular intervention.

The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness.

The high expiratory flow rates, when corrected for lung volume, are likely due to the radial traction on the airway wall, which is a characteristic feature of pulmonary fibrosis. This condition causes scarring and thickening of the lung tissue, leading to decreased lung compliance and increased radial traction on the airway wall during expiration. This results in increased expiratory flow rates.\n\nThe other options are less likely to be the cause of the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient. Anatomical dead space, physiological dead space, and small airway wall thickness are not typically associated with increased expiratory flow rates. Lung compliance, on the other hand, would be reduced in a condition like pulmonary fibrosis, rather than increased."}
