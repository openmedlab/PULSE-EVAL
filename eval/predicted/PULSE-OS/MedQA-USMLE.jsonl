{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nA: CT scan of the abdomen\nB: Transabdominal ultrasonography\nC: Barium enema\nD: Anorectal manometry\nE: Rectal suction biopsy\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Rectal suction biopsy", "predict_answer": "B: Transabdominal ultrasonography is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting, greenish vomitus, distended abdomen, and explosive release of stool after a rectal exam, along with the finding of a section of dilated colon on abdominal x-ray, suggest Hirschsprung's disease. Transabdominal ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging modality that can confirm the diagnosis by visualizing the absence of ganglion cells (nerve cells) in the colon, which is a key feature of Hirschsprung's disease. It is the most appropriate initial test to confirm the diagnosis. CT scan and rectal suction biopsy are not typically used as initial tests for Hirschsprung's disease, and anorectal manometry is not useful in diagnosing the condition."}

On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy.

The trigger in this case was the pain associated with the tattooing. The patient's symptoms of diaphoresis (sweating), pale skin, and jerking movements of the arms and legs (myoclonus) are consistent with a vasovagal response, which is caused by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure due to a vagal reflex triggered by the pain. The fact that she regained consciousness quickly and had no focal neurological deficits suggests that this was not a seizure, and the ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block, which is not typically associated with cardiac arrhythmias or structural abnormalities. Orthostatic syncope is caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing and is not typically triggered by pain. Cardiac arrhythmias would have shown up on the ECG, and her normal examination and vital signs do not suggest a cardiac cause. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is vasovagal syncope.\n\nIt's important to note that other causes of syncope should be ruled out, such as hypoglycemia, heart disease, or medication side effects, and a thorough history and physical exam should be performed to ensure no other causes are present."}

She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?\nA: Excessive production of androgens\nB: Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release\nC: Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation\nD: Nondisjunction of chromosomes\nE: Nutritional imbalance\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release", "predict_answer": "B: Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea. The patient's history of a recent car crash, headaches, and peripheral vision loss suggest a possible pituitary injury or tumor, which can lead to decreased production of GnRH and therefore decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, resulting in amenorrhea. The presence of galactorrhea also supports this possibility, as it is a common symptom of hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma. A pituitary adenoma can also cause visual field defects due to compression of the optic chiasm. Androgens and nutritional imbalances are less likely to cause amenorrhea in this scenario, and disjunction of chromosomes would not cause amenorrhea."}

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands becomes overactive, leading to excessive secretion of PTH. PTH increases calcium levels in the blood, leading to hypercalcemia and can cause calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrolithiasis) and urinary tract, resulting in symptoms such as flank pain and pink urine. The patient's history of fatigue and constipation may also be related to the excess PTH. Pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism involve abnormalities in the body's response to PTH, while tertiary hyperparathyroidism is caused by chronic kidney disease and is less likely given the patient's normal creatinine levels."}

The fact that these symptoms occurred after a fall suggests a possible head injury, which can cause a compressive tumor of the pons. The pons is a part of the brainstem that plays a vital role in controlling eye movement, and a tumor in this area can cause double vision, difficulty in moving the eyes laterally, and nystagmus. The hyperemia seen on fundoscopy may also be related to the increased intracranial pressure caused by the tumor. The other options are less likely because demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus typically causes difficulty with horizontal eye movements, not vertical eye movements, and subdural hematoma would typically cause more severe symptoms such as headache, confusion, and weakness. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency is unlikely given the patient's normal vital signs and lack of other symptoms of thiamine deficiency. Infarction of the brainstem would typically cause more widespread symptoms than just those involving the eyes. A CT scan of the head performed 10 days ago did not show any abnormalities, but it is possible that the tumor was not yet present at that time. The physician may want to consider further imaging studies such as an MRI to confirm the diagnosis."}

Additionally, the fact that the patient has had arthritis for 16 years suggests a chronic condition. Pitting of the nails, also known as \"ungual infolding,\" is a common finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Psoriatic Arthritis is also a possibility, but it typically affects the distal joints and has a different pattern of nail involvement. Arthritis mutilans is a subtype of Rheumatoid Arthritis that is characterized by deformity and destruction of the joints, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest this. Familial Mediterranean Fever is a genetic condition that causes recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain, and is not typically associated with joint symptoms.

He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?\nA: Drug-induced hypokalemia\nB: Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin\nC: Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme\nD: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\nE: Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Drug-induced hypokalemia.\n\nDigitalis toxicity can occur due to a variety of mechanisms, but one of the most common is drug-induced hypokalemia. In this case, the patient has been taking digoxin for a year and has recently started taking verapamil, which is known to increase the risk of digitalis toxicity by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein efflux pump in the gut, leading to increased intestinal absorption of digoxin. However, the patient's serum digoxin level is within the therapeutic range, suggesting that the toxicity is not due to increased absorption. The other mechanisms listed (C, D, and E) are not relevant to this case. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the digitalis toxicity is drug-induced hypokalemia, which can occur as a side effect of digoxin therapy and cause cardiac toxicity. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness are consistent with digitalis toxicity, and the low serum potassium level would support this diagnosis. It is important to correct the hypokalemia and discontinue or adjust the digoxin and verapamil therapy as appropriate to prevent further toxicity."}

While the patient is young and denies risk factors for breast cancer, the presence of a palpable breast mass requires further evaluation. The patient's age and breast size, as well as the tenderness, suggest a benign etiology such as a fibroadenoma, but given the family history, a biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Starting oral contraceptives will not decrease the size of the mass, and the risk of breast cancer is slightly increased with a family history of breast cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: Osteoblasts.\n\nOsteoblasts are cells responsible for bone formation and can differentiate into chondroblasts, which are involved in the formation of cartilage. Transplanting osteoblasts could potentially promote healing in the athletes with cartilaginous injuries by providing a source of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Perichondrium and chondronectin are not involved in cartilage regeneration, and proteoglycans are already present in cartilage, so they would not promote healing. Mature chondrocytes are cells found in cartilage but are not involved in its regeneration, so they would not promote healing either."}

However, taking aspirin can also cause side effects, such as an increased risk of bleeding, especially when used in high doses or for prolonged periods. In this case, the patient's pulse rate is 110/min, which is above the normal range, and taking aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding even further. Therefore, an increased pulse rate is a contraindication to the use of aspirin in this patient.\n\nThe other options are not contraindications to the use of aspirin in this patient:\n\nA: ECG changes - ECG changes by themselves are not a contraindication to the use of aspirin, but they may indicate an underlying heart condition that needs further evaluation before starting aspirin therapy.\n\nB: Hypercholesterolemia - High cholesterol levels are a risk factor for heart disease, and aspirin can help prevent blood clots from forming, which can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Bupropion and citalopram are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that do not typically cause such a significant QT prolongation. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can also prolong the QT interval, but the QT interval is usually around 500 milliseconds, which is higher than the one observed in this case. Sertraline is an SSRI that does not typically cause QT prolongation."}

It is important to note that this decision should be made in consultation with a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare provider who has access to the patient's full medical history and can make individualized treatment recommendations."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken.

However, her sudden shift from gratitude to anger and aggression, along with the new lacerations on her wrists and damage to medical equipment, suggest that she may have borderline personality disorder (BPD). BPD is a mental health condition characterized by intense and unstable emotions, impulsivity, and a fear of abandonment, which can lead to self-harm and impulsive behavior. The patient's anger and aggression may be a result of her fear of abandonment and feeling like she has lost control of the situation. The patient's history of substance abuse, anxiety, and constipation may also be indicative of BPD. A thorough psychiatric evaluation and referral for appropriate treatment may be necessary to manage her symptoms and prevent future self-harm."}

The patient's history of mild bone pain and jaundice, along with the peripheral blood smear findings of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants, are consistent with sickle cell disease. The patient's high reticulocyte count also supports this diagnosis. Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which can cause red blood cells to become misshapen and break down more easily, leading to anemia and pain. The presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells can also cause blockages in small blood vessels, leading to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The elevated total bilirubin level is also consistent with hemolysis, or the breakdown of red blood cells. The hemoglobin electrophoresis result is not provided, but if it confirms the presence of hemoglobin S or HbSC, this would also support the diagnosis of sickle cell disease."}

This condition is characterized by inflammation and stiffness of the shoulder joint capsule, which can make it difficult to move the arm. The patient's history of a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity may have contributed to the development of this condition. Additionally, patients with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension are at an increased risk for adhesive capsulitis.\n\nRotator cuff impingement, option A, is characterized by pain and weakness in the shoulder, but typically does not cause stiffness. Biceps tendinopathy, option C, involves pain and weakness at the elbow, not the shoulder. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis, option D, typically presents with pain and crepitus (a grinding or crackling sound) in the shoulder, but also does not typically cause stiffness. Subacromial bursitis, option E, involves pain and tenderness over the shoulder, but again, does not typically cause stiffness.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam, adhesive capsulitis is the most likely diagnosis.

If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?\nA: Primary spermatocyte\nB: Secondary spermatocyte\nC: Spermatid\nD: Spermatogonium\nE: Spermatozoon\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "A: Primary spermatocyte", "predict_answer": "Based on the presented information, the most likely stage of spermatogenesis at which the error occurred is B: Secondary spermatocyte.\n\nThe patient's physical examination and laboratory studies suggest a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by an extra X chromosome (47,XXY genotype) inherited from the father. This chromosomal abnormality can lead to reduced sperm production and decreased fertility. The increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and increased estradiol:testosterone ratio suggest hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a common finding in Klinefelter syndrome. The small testes and gynecomastia are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nSpermatogenesis is the process of sperm cell development, which occurs in the testes and involves the following stages: spermatogonium, primary spermatocyte, secondary spermatocyte, and spermatid. The primary spermatocyte is the first cell division in meiosis, and it gives rise to two secondary spermatocytes. The secondary spermatocytes then undergo meiotic division to form spermatids, which differentiate into spermatozoa. The cytogenetic abnormality in this case is likely an extra X chromosome, which would lead to a decrease in the number of primary spermatocytes formed, but would not affect the differentiation of the primary spermatocytes into secondary spermatocytes or the subsequent stages of spermatogenesis. Therefore, the error most likely occurred during the secondary spermatocyte stage, which is the stage when the primary spermatocytes divide to form haploid cells that will eventually differentiate into spermatozoa."}

This is a condition characterized by the triad of iron-deficiency anemia, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and esophageal webs. The iron-deficiency anemia is due to blood loss from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The esophageal webs are thought to be caused by chronic inflammation and scarring in the esophagus, and can lead to the difficulty swallowing. The physical exam finding of flat fingernails and mild conjunctival pallor are also consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. Options B, C, and E are less likely because they do not involve the triad of symptoms present in this patient. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma may present with dysphagia, but would not typically cause iron-deficiency anemia. Zenker's diverticulum is a condition where a pouch forms in the esophagus, but would not typically cause iron-deficiency anemia.

Last week she noted several painless red papules on her left thigh when she was on a summer trip to Madagascar. She has no history of serious illnesses and is on no medications. There has been no recent contact with any animals or pets. The temperature is 38.6℃ (101.5℉), the pulse is 78/min, the respiration rate is 12/min, and the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise.

The fact that the patient has a 4-fold rise in serum anti-F1 titers supports this diagnosis, as this test is used to detect antibodies against the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which is a highly infectious agent that can cause tularemia. Tularemia is a serious infectious disease that can be transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as rabbits or rodents, and it can also be contracted through inhalation of contaminated soil or water. The patient's recent travel to Madagascar and the presence of painless red papules on her thigh are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAzithromycin is effective against many gram-negative bacteria, including Francisella tularensis, and is the recommended treatment for tularemia. Imipenem and chloramphenicol are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are not effective against this bacterium, while streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is not commonly used to treat tularemia. Therefore, option A, Erythromycin, would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time.\n\nIt's important to note that tularemia is a serious infectious disease, and the patient should be hospitalized and monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress, as this can be a complication of the disease."}

Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is a commonly used medication for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help reduce symptoms of anxiety. Clomipramine and Phenelzine are tricyclic antidepressants that are not typically used to treat social anxiety disorder. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat anxiety symptoms, but it is not the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder and can be habit-forming. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce physical symptoms of anxiety, but it is not effective for the cognitive and emotional aspects of social anxiety.

He has required escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now having dose limiting side-effects. His pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. Which of the following was the most likely recommended agent?\nA: Propofol\nB: Ketamine\nC: Fentanyl\nD: Ketorolac\nE: Midazolam\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Ketamine", "predict_answer": "B: Ketamine is the most likely agent recommended by the pain management team to reduce the patient's opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a receptor in the brain that plays a role in pain processing and the development of tolerance to opioids. When activated, it can contribute to pain hypersensitivity and the development of opioid tolerance. Thus, medications that interact with the NMDA receptor can help reduce pain and decrease opioid requirements. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which means that it can bind to and block the NMDA receptor, thereby reducing pain and potentially allowing the patient to require lower doses of opioids like morphine. Propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam are not NMDA receptor antagonists, and so they would not be expected to have this effect. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can also reduce pain but does not interact with the NMDA receptor in the same way that ketamine does.\n\nTherefore, option B, Ketamine is the correct answer."}

The coagulation cascade is a complex series of reactions that work together to form a blood clot and stop bleeding. It involves several factors, including VII (vitamin K-dependent clotting factor), X (FIX), XI (plasma thromboplastin), IX (fibrinogen), VIII (antihemophilic factor), and XIIa (platelet activation).\n\nAmong the options provided, VIIa is the coagulation factor that is directly affected by DVT prophylaxis. DVT prophylaxis is usually initiated with the use of heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III, a protein that inactivates factors VIIa, IX, and X. By inhibiting these factors, DVT prophylaxis can prevent the formation of blood clots.\n\nOption A, VII, is incorrect because it refers to the entire VII complex, which includes both VIIa and VIIa. Option B, XIIa, is incorrect because it is not directly affected by DVT prophylaxis.

Opioids are known to depress the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to shallow and slow breathing, which can progress to respiratory failure if left untreated. The low pH and high Pco2 suggest respiratory acidosis, which is a consequence of hyperventilation or hypoventilation, and can also be caused by opioid overdose.

The reason for this is that the patient has taken an unknown amount of an unknown substance, and acetaminophen is a common substance found in many over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers. Acetaminophen is a common cause of acute liver failure, and patients can present with somnolence and other symptoms of toxicity after ingesting a large amount of the drug. The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity is N-acetylcysteine, but it should only be given if the patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of acetaminophen, which can be determined by measuring the blood level of acetaminophen.

The pituitary gland is an endocrine gland located at the base of the brain that produces and regulates several hormones that control various bodily functions. The pituitary gland is divided into two main parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary is composed of corticotrophs, somatotrophs, thyrotrophs, and lactotrophs, which produce and secrete different hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin, respectively. The posterior pituitary produces and secretes oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of headaches and visual field deficit, the most likely origin of the mass is the corticotrophs, which produce ACTH. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, aldosterone, and and androgens. Erectile dysfunction is a known complication of ACTH excess, as it can lead to decreased testosterone production. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a corticotroph adenoma, which is a tumor of the corticotrophs.\n\nIt is important to note that other types of pituitary adenomas can cause different symptoms and hormonal imbalances. For example, a somatotroph adenoma can cause gigantism, acromegaly, and hyperpigmentation, while a lactotroph adenoma can cause hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea or galactorrhea in females.

Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that is used to lower cholesterol levels. It is important to separate the timing of colesevelam administration from other medications, particularly those that are also administered orally, as colesevelam can decrease the absorption of these medications. This is because colesevelam is taken orally and works by binding to bile acids in the gut, which can lead to reduced absorption of other orally administered medications. Therefore, it is important to space out the administration of colesevelam from other medications by at least 4-5 hours to minimize the risk of drug interactions. The patient's other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, and albuterol, should be taken at least 4-5 hours before or after colesevelam to ensure optimal absorption and therapeutic effect.

This condition occurs when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D in the blood. The elevated PTH levels can cause bone turnover, leading to an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone density. This can result in the development of osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture seen on the X-ray of the spine. The patient's low hemoglobin, low calcium, and high phosphorus levels are also consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The pain in the lower back and radiating down the legs is likely caused by the compression of the spinal nerves due to the fracture.\n\nOption A (tertiary hyperparathyroidism) is not a recognized medical term, and option D (primary hyperparathyroidism) is less likely because it is usually associated with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, which are not seen in this patient.

Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?\nA: Squamous cell proliferation\nB: Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells\nC: Excess mucus production by goblet cells\nD: Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells\nE: Proliferation of club cells\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is D: Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells. After damage to the alveoli occurs, the regeneration of the alveolar lining is primarily due to the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells. These cells, also known as type II alveolar cells, secrete surfactant which helps to reduce surface tension in the alveoli and prevent their collapse during exhalation. Surfactant is a mixture of phospholipids and proteins that is synthesized and secreted by type II alveolar cells and is essential for proper lung function. When the alveolar lining is damaged, such as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the surfactant-producing cells can proliferate and secrete surfactant to help rebuild the damaged lining. This process is important for restoring the function of the lung and preventing further respiratory distress. Squamous cell proliferation, excess mucus production by goblet cells, and sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells are not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining."}

This is because these medications increase the activity of the central nervous system, which can affect the digestive system. Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and facial rash are not common side effects of stimulant medications, and profound leukopenia (decrease in white blood cells) is not a known side effect of these medications. Weight gain and change in hair color are not typical side effects of stimulant medications. It is important to discuss the potential side effects of any medication with the parents before starting treatment, so they can make an informed decision and monitor their child for any adverse reactions."}

The newborn's mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-negative, which means that there was a blood group incompatibility between the mother and the fetus. The presence of anti-Rh antibodies in the mother's blood can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells, leading to their destruction and subsequent hemolysis. The newborn's bilirubin level is elevated, and the reticulocyte count is low, which is consistent with hemolysis. The low hemoglobin level and high platelet count are also consistent with hemolysis.\n\nOption A, RBC enzyme deficiency, is unlikely because the reticulocyte count is not low enough to suggest a deficiency of an RBC enzyme. Option B, RBC sickling, is also unlikely because sickling is not mentioned in the history and is not typically associated with hemolytic disease of the newborn. Option D, biliary duct malformation, is not supported by the history or lab findings. Option C, anti-D antibodies, is a possibility, but anti-B antibodies are more likely given the positive anti-Rh titer and the newborn's father's blood type is not mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is E: Anti-B antibodies."}

There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?\nA: Elevation of diaphragm\nB: Ground glass appearance\nC: Widened intercostal spaces\nD: Deep sulcus sign\nE: Blunting of costophrenic angle\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Blunting of costophrenic angle", "predict_answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely finding on a chest x-ray would be a consolidation or opacity involving the left lung, which would suggest an infection or inflammation in that lung. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Blunting of costophrenic angle. The costophrenic angle is the angle formed between the diaphragm and the rib where the costochondral junction of the 8th rib meets the manubrium (the breastbone). When there is fluid or consolidation in the lung tissue, it can push on the diaphragm and cause the angle to become less prominent, resulting in blunting. This is a common finding in conditions such as pneumonia or consolidation due to fluid. The other options are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and history as well as blunting of the costophrenic angle. Elevation of diaphragm would suggest a diaphragmatic elevation, which is not typically seen with a consolidation. Ground glass appearance is a finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions, including viral and bacterial pneumonia, but is not specific to a consolidation. Widened intercostal spaces are more likely to be seen in emphysema, and deep sulcus is a finding that can be seen in conditions such as bullous emphysema."}

The location of the painless lump near the left wrist and the associated tingling pain over the left hand suggests the possibility of ulnar nerve entrapment, which can occur at the wrist, where the ulnar nerve passes through the Guyon's canal, a narrow passage beneath the flexor carpi radialis tendon and behind the pisiform bone. The decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand also supports this possibility as the ulnar nerve innervates the muscles that control finger movements and sensation in these areas.\n\nThe ulnar artery (option A) and extensor pollicis brevis tendon (option B) are not at risk of entrapment in this case, as they are located on the other side of the wrist. The flexor pollicis longus tendon (option C) and flexor carpi radialis tendon (option D) are also not at risk of entrapment at the wrist, as they are located on the palmar side of the wrist.\n\nTherefore, the most likely structure at risk of entrapment if the mass persists is the ulnar nerve."}

It can also lead to atrophy of the labia minora and retraction of the clitoris. Squamous cell hyperplasia and squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva typically present with red, scaly patches or masses, while lichen planus typically presents with purple or brownish-purple papules or plaques. Atrophic vaginitis is also a possibility, but the presence of the vulvar and perianal skin changes suggest lichen sclerosis as the more likely diagnosis. A biopsy may be necessary for confirmation."}

The presence of a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass with a yellow hue at the edge of the exocervical os raises suspicion for a Bartholin's gland cyst or abscess. A colposcopy and biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine if the cyst is benign or malignant. The patient's history of regular menstrual periods and lack of recent sexual activity suggest that the cyst is likely a Bartholin's gland cyst. However, the yellow hue may indicate an infected cyst or abscess, and a biopsy would help to differentiate between the two. Electrocautery and cryofreezing are not typically used for Bartholin's gland cysts, and administration of antibiotics may be considered if an infection is present, but a biopsy would still be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

This is because the patient's symptoms are suggestive of uterine fibroids, which are benign muscle tumors that can grow in the uterus and cause symptoms such as heavy periods, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. The rectouterine septum is the area between the uterus and the rectum, and nodularity in this area may indicate the presence of fibroids. A globular 10-week sized uterus (option B) would also be consistent with uterine fibroids, but nodularity is a more specific finding that would suggest the location of the fibroids. An adnexal mass (option C) is less likely given the patient's history of five spontaneous vaginal deliveries and lack of bowel changes. An irregular 14-week sized uterus (option D) is not a specific finding and could be due to many other causes.

Which of the following is associated with this patient’s condition?\nA: Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nB: Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone\nC: Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume\nD: Increased renal blood flow\nE: Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is C: Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and edema, as well as the bibasilar crackles on chest auscultation, suggest congestive heart failure (CHF). Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs and other tissues, including the legs and abdomen. This fluid accumulation is caused by increased venous pressure due to decreased cardiac output, which leads to sodium and water retention in the body. This increased fluid accumulation results in an increase in ECF volume, which is the fluid outside of cells. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) would lead to increased ECF volume, while increased renal blood flow and increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption would lead to decreased ECF volume. Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone would not be associated with this patient's condition."}

The current recommended treatment for chronic Hepatitis C is a combination of direct-acting antivirals, such as Sofosbuvir and Simeprevir, which have been shown to have high sustained virologic response rates and are generally well-tolerated. Interferon-based regimens, such as Interferon-alpha, Interferon-gamma, and Ribavirin, are no longer considered the standard of care and are not recommended due to their lower efficacy and more severe side effects. Lamivudine is not effective against Hepatitis C.\n\nIt's important to note that the patient's other comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina, should also be managed and closely monitored during treatment. Additionally, his alcohol and smoking use should be addressed as they can worsen liver disease and affect the response to treatment.

In thyroid storm, the heart rate is typically rapid and irregular, and the PR interval is shortened. The PR interval represents the time between the beginning of the QRS complex and the end of the PR segment of the ECG, and it is measured in milliseconds. In thyroid storm, there is an increase in the thyroid hormone levels, which leads to an increase in the heart rate and a shortened PR interval due to the increased beta-1 receptor stimulation. The shortened PR interval is a result of increased adrenergic stimulation, which leads to increased beta-1 receptor stimulation, resulting in increased heart rate and contractility.\n\nOption A, Digoxin level, is not relevant to the diagnosis of thyroid storm. Option C, QT interval, is the time between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the next QRS complex and is not related to thyroid storm.

It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors in the airways, which leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle around the airways and improved airflow. This makes it an appropriate treatment for a patient with chronic bronchitis and symptoms of shortness of breath and productive cough.\n\nFluticasone is a steroid that is used to reduce inflammation in the airways and is not typically used as a first-line treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is used to treat asthma and allergies and would not be effective in this patient. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that is used for relief of symptoms of bronchospasm, but is not a long-term control medication.

Biopsy specimens from the affected areas of the colon show noncaseating granulomas, which are a specific finding for Crohn's disease. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts (A) can occur in many different inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and infectious colitis. Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes (B) are a finding that is more specific for ulcerative colitis. Inflammation limited to the mucosa and submucosa (D) is a feature of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but it is not specific to either condition.

Photosensitivity is a hypersensitivity reaction to sunlight that can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications, infections, and underlying skin diseases. In this case, the patient's history of occasional sunburns when not using sunscreen and her light skin type make her more susceptible to photosensitivity reactions.\n\nMastocytosis is a condition characterized by an over-activation of mast cells, which are involved in the body's immune response and play a role in allergic reactions. Presensitization refers to the release of mast cell mediators in response to a trigger, such as sunlight, without an immediate allergic reaction. Degranulation of presensitized mast cells can cause a similar reaction to an allergic reaction, leading to the symptoms described by the patient. The patient's current medications, demeclocycline and amoxicillin, are not known to cause photosensitivity reactions, and the other options, such as drug-induced autoantibodies, lymphocyte-mediated allergic reactions, and accumulation of porphobilinogen, are less likely given the timing and presentation of the symptoms."}

Alimentary hypoglycemia is a condition in which the body is unable to properly process carbohydrates and glucose is absorbed from the gut, leading to low blood sugar levels. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, surgeries, or digestive disorders. The fact that the patient has a family history of diabetes and a history of a difficult divorce may also be relevant, as stress can affect blood sugar levels. Insulinoma is a rare condition in which there is overproduction of insulin, which would not explain the low blood sugar levels.

The ventricular septal defect allows for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, leading to cyanosis. The pulmonary stenosis reduces blood flow to the lungs, leading to progressive respiratory failure. The right ventricular hypertrophy is a result of the increased workload on the right ventricle due to the pulmonary stenosis, and the overriding aorta results in an enlarged \"egg-shaped\" heart. An atrial septostomy can be performed to relieve the cyanosis by shunting blood from the left to the right atrium to increase pulmonary blood flow, but definitive surgical correction is required for long-term management.

This is because the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and clammy, cold extremities after delivery, which are symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage, a potentially life-threatening complication of childbirth characterized by excessive bleeding. This can lead to hypovolemia, or a decrease in blood volume, which can cause a decrease in blood flow to the breast and a failure of lactation. The administration of IV fluids and whole blood helped to stabilize the patient's vitals, but if the bleeding was severe enough, it could have affected the blood supply to the breast tissue, leading to a failure of lactation.

It is important to acknowledge and respect the parents' decision-making autonomy and involve them in the decision-making process. The physician should provide them with accurate information about the risks and benefits of chemotherapy and the potential consequences of refusing treatment, but ultimately, the decision should be respected. The physician can offer to help the parents arrange for supportive care at home, which may include pain management, symptom control, and palliative care to improve the child's quality of life. The physician can also provide them with resources and support to help them cope with the situation. Referral to another oncologist or seeking a court order for treatment would not be appropriate in this scenario as it would not respect the parents' decision and could cause further distress. Surgical resection may not be an option if the tumor is unresectable, and therefore, it is not a viable choice."}

Since the patient's vital signs are all within normal limits and there are no other symptoms, it is less likely that this is due to a systemic issue such as an adrenal crisis or generalized infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect miosis in the left eye and normal dilation in the right eye."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left foot. She has had decreased appetite and a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months. Physical examination shows that on the left medial ankle there is a 2-cm reddish-black nodule with a verrucous surface. A full-thickness excisional biopsy of the lesion shows S100-protein-positive epithelioid cells. A subsequent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows metastases to the liver; a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is made. Chemotherapy with aldesleukin is initiated. Which of the following is the mechanism of action for this drug?\nA: Stimulating release of acute-phase reactants\nB: Stimulating antigen-processing cells\nC: Inhibiting expression of MHC II and Th1 cytokines\nD: Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells\nE: Supporting growth of bone marrow stem cells\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is D: Activating natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells.\n\nExplanation:\nAldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune system. It is a glycoprotein that is secreted by T cells and has multiple effects on the immune system, including the activation of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells and NK cells, leading to their activation and increased cytotoxicity against cancer cells. It also enhances the activity of other immune cells, such as macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, which can help to destroy cancer cells.\n\nIn the case of the patient described, the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma was made, and aldesleukin was initiated as part of the chemotherapy treatment. The mechanism of action of aldesleukin in this case is to activate the patient's immune system, specifically the NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, to help destroy the cancer cells. This is why aldesleukin is sometimes used in the treatment of melanoma, as it can help the patient's immune system to better recognize and attack the cancer cells. The other options listed do not accurately describe the mechanism of action of aldesleukin."}

The fact that the patient was recently in northern Maine, an area where Lyme disease is endemic, and spent most of her time outdoors increases the likelihood of exposure to infected ticks.\n\nTicks that carry the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, are commonly found in the northeastern and north-central United States, including Maine. Tsetse flies, Culicidae, and Dermacentor variabilis are not known to transmit Lyme disease.\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, which are commonly found in wooded and grassy areas. The tick must be attached for at least 36-48 hours before the bacteria can be transmitted, so it's important for individuals in endemic areas to take precautions such as wearing protective clothing, using tick repellent, and performing tick checks after spending time outdoors. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more severe symptoms, including arthritis, meningitis, and cardiac and neurological problems.\n\nIt's important for the patient to seek medical attention promptly for appropriate diagnosis and treatment, which may include antibiotics to prevent further complications."}

This is because the symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing, listlessness, and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur are consistent with a congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot, which is commonly associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material on chromosome 22 and can result in a wide range of abnormalities, including congenital heart defects. The holosystolic murmur heard during the physical exam is also consistent with this diagnosis. The other options, such as deletion of genes on chromosome 7, lithium exposure in utero, and maternal alcohol consumption, are less likely to cause these specific symptoms in a 3-month-old infant. Retinoic acid exposure in utero can cause some congenital abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described in this case."}

While the risk of developing gynecomastia is relatively low, it is still a potential side effect that should be considered and monitored by a physician.\n\nAgranulocytosis is a serious adverse effect that can occur with many antipsychotic medications, but it is more commonly associated with the use of clozapine and other atypical antipsychotics, not risperidone. Shortened QT interval is a risk associated with the use of some antipsychotics, but it is not a known side effect of risperidone. Hypothyroidism can occur as a result of antipsychotic use, but it is not a common side effect of risperidone specifically.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion and can be effective in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause difficulty swallowing and heartburn. Eosinophilic infiltration on mucosal biopsy can also suggest eosinophilic esophagitis, which is often associated with GERD. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension, and Fluconazole is an antifungal medication. Nitroglycerin is a nitrate used to treat angina, and while it may help with heartburn, it will not address the underlying cause of the difficulty swallowing.

The patient's symptoms, along with the finding of oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines on stool examination and granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis on liver biopsy, are highly suggestive of a parasitic infection called Schistosomiasis, which is caused by freshwater snails. Schistosomiasis is a common infection in Uganda and other parts of Africa, and the eggs of the parasite can hatch in the intestine, causing diarrhea and abdominal pain. The eggs then travel to the liver through the portal vein, where they can cause inflammation and fibrosis. The patient's recent immigration to the US suggests that she may have been infected before coming to the US. Tsetse flies, which are found in sub-Saharan Africa, can transmit other parasites, such as trypanosomes, but not schistosomiasis. Undercooked pork and fish meat can cause trichinella infection, which has a different clinical presentation.

CRAO occurs when the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the majority of the retina, becomes blocked, leading to ischemia (lack of blood flow) and subsequent neuronal damage. This can result in a pale or white retina with a bright red area, called a \"copper-coin\" or \"tomato\" sign, due to the leakage of blood from the retinal vessels. The absence of the direct pupillary reflex in the affected eye, along with the normal optic disc, is also consistent with CRAO. In contrast, central retinal vein occlusion (CVO) would result in a pale or white retina with a cherry-red spot due to the accumulation of blood in the retinal veins. Retinal detachment would present with a curtain or veil-like obstruction of vision, and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy would cause a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) rather than an absent direct pupillary reflex. Acute angle-closure glaucoma would cause a sudden, painful loss of vision in both eyes. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as her lack of adherence to her medication regimen, increases her risk for CRAO. Prompt treatment is necessary to minimize vision loss, including administration of intravenous antiplatelet agents and consideration of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy."}

This involves collecting a sample of skin scraping from the affected area and placing it on a microscope slide, then adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the slide and observing it under a microscope for the presence of fungal elements. This is a simple and quick test that can provide a definitive diagnosis. Localized ultrasound, Gram stain, and AFB stain are not typically used to diagnose fungal infections and are not appropriate for this case. Nikolsky's sign, which is the presence of fungal elements on the skin surface after applying pressure to the affected area, is not specific to Tinea cruris and can also be seen in other fungal infections, bacterial infections, and some autoimmune diseases, so it is not a confirmatory test."}

This type of study design involves looking back at existing data to investigate the relationship between an exposure (in this case, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) and an outcome (breast cancer). The researchers identified a group of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided them into two groups based on whether or not they had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. They then compared the proportion of women in each group who developed breast cancer and reported an odds ratio to estimate the strength of association between the exposure and the outcome. Retrospective cohort studies are useful when a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not feasible or ethical, and they can provide valuable information about the potential benefits and harms of a medical intervention.

This means that the denominator (total number of patients at risk) will be larger, resulting in a lower incidence rate. Conversely, as the time period chosen for the study increases, the number of patients included in the study population decreases, resulting in a smaller denominator, leading to a higher incidence rate. However, the prevalence rate will remain the same, regardless of the time period chosen, as it is a snapshot in time representing the total number of patients with SLE at a given point in time. Therefore, examining the data for a shorter time period will result in an overestimation of prevalence, as it will include patients who were diagnosed earlier and have been diagnosed for a longer period of time, inflating the prevalence rate."}

This is the correct method of transporting an amputated finger because it helps to preserve the amputated finger and minimize tissue damage. The moist gauze helps to keep the finger moist and the plastic bag helps to keep it clean and free from contamination. Placing it on ice slows down the metabolic processes in the finger, which can help to preserve the tissue and minimize cell death. This method will give the finger the best chance of being reattached successfully.\n\nOption A, submerging the finger in ice water, is not recommended because the extreme cold temperature can cause further damage to the tissue and decrease the chances of successful reattachment. Option B, wrapping the finger in moist gauze, does not provide enough protection for the finger and may lead to contamination. Option C, wrapping the finger in moist gauze and placing it on ice, is similar to option D but does not provide the added protection of a plastic bag.

However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).

The difference in the relationship between CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and DLBCL risk observed between the two strata is due to effect modification, which refers to the phenomenon where the relationship between an exposure and an outcome varies depending on the level of a third variable, such as CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in this case. In this study, the authors found that cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not among those with counts above 200/mm3. This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be modified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, meaning that the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different for patients with low and high CD4+ cell counts. This is an example of effect modification, where the effect of the exposure (cART adherence) differs depending on the level of the moderator (CD4+ T-lymphocyte count)."}

Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation.

It works by blocking the integrase enzyme, which is essential for the replication of the HIV virus. By inhibiting integrase, raltegravir prevents the integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's DNA, thereby preventing the virus from replicating. It is used in the treatment of HIV infection and is often given in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. The other options provided are not integrase inhibitors and do not act in the same way:\n\nA: Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that blocks the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane, preventing viral entry.\n\nB: Efavirenz is an NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) that inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is necessary for the virus to replicate.\n\nC: Ritonavir is a booster that increases the concentration of other antiretroviral drugs by inhibiting their metabolism in the liver, but it does not directly target the virus.\n\nE: Lamivudine is an NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) that inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is necessary for the virus to replicate.\n\nSince the patient's current treatment with dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine has led to a decrease in CD4 count and an increase in viral load, switching to a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation suggests a drug that inhibits a step in the viral life cycle other than reverse transcription.

The high blood glucose level (630 mg/dL) and positive urine glucose and ketones indicate that the body is not able to effectively use glucose for energy and is breaking down fat for energy, leading to the production of ketones. The metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1, PCO2 33 mm Hg, HCO3 8 mEq/L) is caused by the accumulation of ketones in the blood. The low serum potassium level (3.1 mEq/L) is a consequence of the shift of potassium into cells in exchange for glucose. DKA is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent complications such as cerebral edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and coma.\n\nThe first step in the management of DKA is to start an intravenous insulin infusion to lower the blood glucose level. This will help to stop the production of ketones and reverse the metabolic acidosis. The insulin infusion should be started as soon as possible, and the rate and dosage will depend on the patient's blood glucose level, age, and comorbidities. After the insulin infusion is started, the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, should be monitored and replaced if necessary. Option A (infuse NaHCO3 slowly) is not appropriate as it will not address the underlying cause of the metabolic acidosis. Option B (switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl) is not necessary as the patient's electrolyte levels are not significantly imbalanced. Option D (replace potassium intravenously) may be necessary if the patient's potassium level is significantly low, but it is not the next step after starting the insulin infusion. Option E (start IV 5% dextrose) is not appropriate as it will increase the blood glucose level further, exacerbating the metabolic acidosis.\n\nIn summary, the priority in the management of DKA is to start an intravenous insulin infusion to lower the blood glucose level and stop the production of ketones."}

The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?\nA: Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma\nB: Dissection of an intracerebral vessel\nC: Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses\nD: Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm\nE: Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles", "predict_answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely mechanism underlying her headaches is \"C: Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses.\"\n\nThe patient's headache is described as \"band-like\" and extends to the neck, which suggests a tension-type headache. The fact that the headache is worse in the morning and after breakfast suggests a possible connection to her nasal congestion and sinus pressure, which can cause tension headaches. Additionally, her recent runny nose and temperature elevation suggest a possible sinus infection or inflammation. The physical examination finding of S2 accentuation, which is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, also supports this possibility as this sound is caused by turbulent blood flow through a narrowed vessel, which can be caused by inflammation or congestion in the paranasal sinuses. The absence of other neurological symptoms, such as focal weakness or meningeal irritation, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's hypertension and medication regimen do not seem to be related to the headache.\n\nOption A, meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma, is less likely because the headache is not worsened by movement and there is no focal neurological deficit. Option B, dissection of an intracerebral vessel, is also less likely because there is no evidence of neurological symptoms or focal deficits. Option D, dilation of intracerebral arterioles, is less likely because there is no evidence of neurological symptoms. Option E, dilation of intracerebral arterioles, is also less likely because there is no evidence of neurological symptoms."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 70-year-old man presents with cough and progressively worsening shortness of breath for the last 6 months. He feels short of breath even without exertion and states he ‘got winded’ while walking to his bedroom last night. He describes his cough as non-productive and says he can identify no recognizable triggers. No significant past medical history. The patient is a retired welder and has been living with his son since his wife passed away 5 years ago. He denies any smoking history or current alcohol or drug use. His vital signs include: pulse rate 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 134/80 mm Hg, and temperature 36.8°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, digital clubbing is noted. Bilateral basilar fine crackles on noted on pulmonary auscultation. Expiratory flow rates are measured and found to be high when corrected for lung volume. A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?\nA: Anatomical dead space\nB: Lung compliance\nC: Physiological dead space\nD: Radial traction on airway wall\nE: Small airway wall thickness\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Radial traction on airway wall", "predict_answer": "The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is most likely due to C: Physiological dead space.\n\nPhysiological dead space refers to the air that remains in the conducting airways and alveolar ducts after a normal expiration, but before the next inhalation. This air is trapped and cannot participate in gas exchange, and it accounts for approximately 1/3 of the total lung volume. This trapped air can cause an increase in the amount of air that needs to be expired during the next breath, leading to an increased expiratory flow rate. In this patient, the bilateral basilar fine crackles on pulmonary auscultation suggest some degree of air trapping, which is a common finding in patients with emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The non-productive cough and shortness of breath with no triggers, along with the history of being a retired welder, suggest a possible occupational exposure to irritants such as asbestos or silica, which are known to cause COPD. The digital clubbing also suggests long-standing hypoxemia, which is a common finding in COPD patients. The chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, which is a common finding in COPD patients due to chronic air trapping. Therefore, the combination of physical examination findings and the chest X-ray suggests that this patient has COPD, which is causing the increased expiratory flow rate due to physiological dead space."}

The consolidation in the apical part of the right lung on the chest radiograph is highly suggestive of a lung infiltrate, which is a common finding in tuberculosis. The low-grade fever, loss of appetite, productive cough, and night sweats are also typical symptoms of the disease. The low hemoglobin level and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest anemia, which can occur in advanced stages of the disease. The differential count shows a high proportion of lymphocytes, which is a common feature in tuberculosis. The statement that best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient is D: An ill-defined granuloma with macrophages and epithelioid cells is seen in this type of inflammation. This is because tuberculosis is a granulomatous disease characterized by the formation of ill-defined granulomas with central necrosis and surrounded by epithelioid cells, macrophages, and Langhans cells. The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and radiological findings in this patient."}

The null hypothesis is that there is no association between low birth weight and obesity. The researcher has conducted a study with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value of 0.049, and has rejected the null hypothesis. This means that the researcher has concluded that there is a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity.\n\nHowever, the confidence interval is 95%, which means that there is a 5% chance of a type 2 error (i.e., concluding that there is an association when there is no true association). The p-value of 0.049 is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, which means that the researcher may have incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D: A type 2 error has been made.\n\nA type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, resulting in concluding that there is an association when there is no true association. This can happen when the sample size is too small, the significance level is too low, or the confidence interval is too narrow. In this case, the confidence interval of 95% may be too narrow, which increases the chance of a type 2 error. A 95% confidence interval means that the true population parameter lies within the interval with 95% probability, but it does not guarantee that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value of 0.049 is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, which means that the researcher may have incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis.\n\nThe other answer choices are incorrect because:\n\nA: A 90% confidence interval would not necessarily solve the problem of a type 2 error.\nB: A type 2 error is always possible in hypothesis testing.\nC: The null hypothesis should have been rejected if the researcher found a statistically significant association.\nE: A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, which is not the case in this scenario."}

Which of the following findings are most likely to be seen on physical examination of this patient?\nA: Frontal balding and cataracts\nB: Long face and large everted ears\nC: Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth\nD: Flat facies and protruding tongue\nE: Thin upper lip and receding chin\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Long face and large everted ears", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is C: Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth.\n\nThe physical examination finding most likely to be seen in a 15-year-old boy with an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats, who is presenting with hyperactivity, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments is almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth. This is because the patient may have Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat on the FMR1 gene. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects males and is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical features such as a long face, large everted ears, and a prominent jaw. However, the most distinctive physical feature of the syndrome is the \"drooping mouth\" or \"downward slanting of the mouth\" which is caused by the lack of a protein called fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The lack of FMRP leads to overgrowth of the upper jaw and undergrowth of the lower jaw, resulting in an elongated face and a downturned mouth. The almond-shaped eyes are also characteristic of the syndrome. Frontal balding and cataracts are not typically associated with fragile X syndrome, and thin upper lip and receding chin are more commonly seen in other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Flat facies and protruding tongue are not typically seen in fragile X syndrome."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?\nA: Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume\nB: Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume\nC: Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume\nD: Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume\nE: Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "C: Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is E: Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion suggest pulmonary emphysema, which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In COPD, the alveoli in the lungs are damaged, and the airways become narrowed, making it difficult for air to flow in and out of the lungs. As a result, the patient has a decreased 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) but a normal residual volume (RV). This is because the RV is the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a maximum exhale, and the damaged alveoli cannot hold as much air as healthy alveoli, resulting in a smaller RV. However, the total lung capacity (TLC) is still normal because the damaged alveoli are compensated by hyperinflation of other areas of the lung. The increased chest diameter is due to hyperinflation of the remaining healthy lung tissue.\n\nSmoking is a significant risk factor for COPD, and the patient's history of smoking for 55 years increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes may also contribute to the development of COPD. The patient's past history of prostate cancer is not related to his current symptoms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a decreased residual volume is not a finding in COPD.\nOption B is incorrect because an increased 1-second forced expiratory volume is not a finding in COPD.\nOption C is incorrect because an increased residual volume is not a finding in COPD.\nOption D is incorrect because an increased 1-second forced expiratory volume is not a finding in COPD."}
