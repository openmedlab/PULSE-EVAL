It can be bilateral or unilateral depending on the affected part of the iris.  The iris is composed of two parts, the choroid and the sclera.  The choroid is the colored part of the iris and the sclera is the white part of the iris.  The choroid is responsible for determining the size of the pupil.  The sclera is responsible for determining the shape of the pupil.  The choroid is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system and the sclera is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are antagonistic to each other.  The sympathetic system is responsible for constricting the pupil and the parasympathetic system is responsible for dialating the pupil.  The mydriatic effect of the sympathetic system is greater than that of the parasympathetic system.\n\n The parasympathetic fibers are responsible for dialating the pupil.  The parasympathetic fibers originate from the ciliary ganglion of the eye.  The sympathetic fibers are responsible for constricting the pupil.  The sympathetic fibers originate from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\nMiosis can be bilateral or unilateral depending on which part of the iris is affected.  If both parts of the iris are affected, the mydriatic effect is less.  If only one part of the iris is affected, the mydriatic effect is greater.\n\nMiosis can also be complete or partial.  If the iris is completely constricted, it is called complete miosis.  If the iris is partially constricted, it is called partial miosis.\n\nMiosis can also be transient or permanent.  Transient miosis is when the mydriatic effect is transient.  Permanent miosis is when the mydriatic effect is permanent.\n\nMiosis can also be general or local.  General miosis is when both parts of the iris are constricted.  Local miosis is when one part of the iris is constricted and the other part is dialated.\n\nMiosis can also be direct or indirect.  Direct miosis is when the iris is constricted directly.  Indirect miosis is when the iris is constricted indirectly.\n\nMiosis can also be natural or mechanical.  Natural miosis is when the iris is constricted by its own dialator muscle.  Mechanical miosis is when the iris is constricted by other than its own dialator muscle.\n\nMiosis can also be physiologic or pathologic.  Physiologic miosis is when the iris is constricted due to the will of the patient.
