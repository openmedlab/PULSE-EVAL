Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?\nA: Drug-induced hypokalemia\nB: Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin\nC: Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme\nD: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\nE: Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Drug-induced hypokalemia. Digitalis toxicity can occur when patients take too much digoxin or if they have conditions that affect the excretion of digoxin from the body. One mechanism by which digitalis toxicity can develop is drug-induced hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can lead to an increase in the duration of repolarization of the cardiac action potential, causing the heart to beat irregularly. This effect is known as EKG changes consistent with digitalis toxicity. Other mechanisms include increased intestinal absorption of digoxin, inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, inhibition of P-glycoprotein, and increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin. However, only drug-induced hypokalemia is directly related to the mechanism of digitalis toxicity."}

She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, “I'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.” She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?\nA: Lysosomes\nB: Rough endoplasmic reticulum\nC: Nucleus\nD: Extracellular space\nE: Free ribosomes\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Rough endoplasmic reticulum", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Lysosomes.\nTo answer this question, we need to understand the role of lysosomes in the cell and how they relate to coagulation. Lysosomes are organelles within the cell that break down waste materials and macromolecules. They contain various enzymes that can digest proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. In the case of this patient, there is a defect in blood coagulation, specifically with bleeding times and prolonged PT and PTT values. This indicates a problem with either the activation of factors or the inhibition of proteins that control coagulation. Within the lysosomes, there are enzymes that can activate or inhibit coagulation factors. Defects in these reactions can lead to abnormalities in blood coagulation, as seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely association with her condition is a defect in a reaction that occurs in lysosomes."}

After carefully reviewing the case and considering all of the possible answers, I believe the correct answer is C: Add fluticasone daily.\n\nThe patient's symptoms indicate that his asthma is not well controlled despite using an albuterol inhaler as needed. He is waking up multiple times at night due to his symptoms, which is a clear indicator that his asthma is severe. Additionally, he is having difficulty keeping up with his friends in the playground, suggesting that his asthma may be affecting his quality of life.\n\nFluticasone is a corticosteroid used to control asthma symptoms by reducing inflammation in the airways. It works to prevent the airway from becoming hyperresponsive to allergens and other triggers. By adding fluticasone to the patient's current treatment regimen, it could help improve his asthma control and decrease his symptoms. This will allow him to participate more fully in activities and reduce the number of times he needs to use his albuterol inhaler.\n\nWhile options B, D, and E involve adding additional medications to help control the patient's asthma, these options do not address the underlying inflammation that is causing his symptoms. Adding cromolyn or salmeterol would provide additional relief from symptoms but would not address the inflammation, while adding zileuton would not be effective in managing asthma symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate change to the patient's current asthma treatment regimen would be to add fluticasone daily. This would help to control the inflammation in his airways and potentially reduce his symptoms and the frequency with which he needs to use his albuterol inhaler."}

This patient has decreased blood pressure secondary to intravenous fluid loss from epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia causes a blockage of the sympathetic chain, which can lead to decreased heart rate and blood pressure due to insufficient vasoconstriction. The patient may also have had some blood loss during the epidural procedure or during the time period that she has been connected to the IV fluids. Both of these factors can contribute to her hypotension. Decreased cardiac contractility would not cause hypotension but rather would cause tachycardia. Hypovolemia would be the most likely explanation for her symptoms because it is the only choice that directly relates to fluid loss. Acute pulmonary hypertension would not cause hypotension but rather would cause dyspnea and a rapid heart rate. Aortocaval compression would not cause hypotension unless there was significant abdominal distention, which would not be present in this patient."}

His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?\nA: High-dose IV dexamethasone\nB: Immediate debridement\nC: Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics\nD: Biopsy of wound\nE: Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "C: Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics", "predict_answer": "The patient presented with signs of sepsis and a painful wound that appears to be infected. Empiric antibiotic treatment should be initiated immediately until the results of culture and sensitivity tests come back. High-dose IV dexamethasone can be used for its anti-inflammatory effects but would not address the infection or the need for immediate debridement if necessary. Debridement may be needed depending on the severity of the infection and the tissue damage. If the wound is severely infected, it may need to be done immediately. A biopsy of the wound would not be helpful without culture and sensitivity results. Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen would not be useful in managing this patient's condition unless it revealed an underlying source of infection such as an abscess.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics."}

Alcohol abuse can lead to chronic liver disease, which causes increased levels of neurohormones such as norepinephrine, aldosterone, and vasopressin. These increase cardiac output, constrict blood vessels, and cause sodium retention, all of which contribute to the development of CHF. Bibasilar crackles are heard on auscultation, suggesting pulmonary edema due to the increased capillary pressure caused by the fluid retention. Extra pillows at night and difficulty breathing are also consistent with CHF. A complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and creatinine would further support the diagnosis."}

This patient's heart rhythm is characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeats, which are consistent with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be associated with prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, potentially life-threatening conditions. The other options have no relation to this patient's heart rhythm. Digoxin blood level would not help diagnose the heart rhythm problem because digoxin does not affect atrial fibrillation. PR interval is not affected by atrial fibrillation. Age may correlate with the development of atrial fibrillation but it is not directly related to the heart rhythm itself. Amiodarone blood level would not help diagnose the heart rhythm problem because amiodarone is not used to treat atrial fibrillation."}

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA: Degranulation of presensitized mast cells\nB: Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies\nC: Lymphocyte-mediated allergic reaction\nD: Accumulation of porphobilinogen\nE: Cell injury due to drug metabolites\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Cell injury due to drug metabolites", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is C. This patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a lymphocyte-mediated allergic reaction. Sun exposure can lead to a photoallergic reaction, which is an immune-mediated reaction. In this case, the patient may have been sensitized to a photoreactive chemical in her skin or environment, leading to a contact dermatitis-like reaction upon further sun exposure. Demeclocycline and amoxicillin are unlikely to contribute to this reaction as they are not known to cause photosensitivity. Mast cell degranulation (A) would cause anaphylaxis, not a contact dermatitis-like reaction; formation of drug-induced autoantibodies (B) would be more consistent with a drug eruption, but is unlikely here; accumulation of porphobilinogen (D) would cause porphyria cutanea tarda, which presents with a different clinical pattern; and cell injury due to drug metabolites (E) would be more consistent with a drug eruption, but is unlikely here given the timing of the reaction."}

What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?\nA: Insulinoma\nB: Factitious disorder\nC: Alimentary hypogylcemia\nD: Hypothyroidism\nE: Somatization disorder\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Factitious disorder", "predict_answer": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). While insulinoma could cause DKA, it is less likely as C-peptide levels were decreased suggesting insulin production was decreased. Additionally, factitious disorder would involve intentional manipulation of her blood glucose levels which does not align with the presentation of DKA. Alimentary hypoglycemia is caused by malabsorption of glucose and would not present with hyperglycemia. Hypothyroidism can cause hypoglycemia but not hyperglycemia. Finally, somatization disorder presents with multiple physical complaints without any identifiable medical cause; however, there is no evidence to suggest this patient's symptoms are not real. Given the patient's history of recent stressors and her family history of diabetes, it is most likely that this patient's condition is due to some combination of emotional stress and genetic predisposition. Emotional stress can lead to a cascade of physiological responses including cortisol release, increased appetite for carbohydrates, and decreased insulin sensitivity. This can result in hyperglycemia and lead to an episode of DKA."}

This patient presented with sudden vision changes in both eyes, most likely due to a blockage of the middle cerebral artery. The middle cerebral artery supplies blood to the majority of the parieto-occipital lobes as well as portions of the frontal lobe. Blockage of this vessel can cause loss of vision in the affected hemisphere. Extraocular movements were intact suggesting that the lesion was not in the posterior circulation.

His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others.

Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal.

First, it requires an understanding of the anatomy of the eye and how it relates to the pathophysiology of each of the listed diseases. Second, it requires knowledge of the presentation of each disease as well as its expected findings on ocular exam. Finally, it requires an understanding of the effects of various medical conditions on the eye and the ability to make inferences based on the patient's history.\nThe correct answer should be E (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy). This is the only disease listed that involves the optic nerve rather than the retina or the choroid. It is also the only disease where there would be no direct pupillary response in the affected eye. However, given the patient's history of nonadherence to her medications, it is possible that she may have had a prior central retinal vein occlusion (answer A). This could explain the pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus increase the risk for both a retinal vein occlusion and a retinal artery occlusion (answers C and D). However, the absence of a red eye and the presence of a normal appearing optic disc argue against these diagnoses. Finally, answers B and E can both result in loss of vision, but typically involve swelling of the optic nerve head rather than a pale retina. In addition, acute angle closure glaucoma usually presents with a sudden, severe eye pain."}

Scabies is characterized by intense itching, especially at night, and a typical linear rash that often follows areas of skin in contact with bedding or clothing. Nikolsky's sign, which involves applying a mildly abrasive agent like cellulose paste or woodscrews and observing an increased itch response, can be used to diagnose scabies. However, confirmation of the diagnosis requires microscopic examination of scrapings from the skin lesion using potassium hydroxide (KOH). A Gram stain would not be helpful because bacteria are not involved in scabies pathogenesis. Ultrasound would not be diagnostic but could potentially show evidence of other conditions such as inguinal adenitis or epididymitis."}

Effect modification occurs when an exposure (e.g., cART adherence) modifies the relationship between an independent variable (e.g., CD4+ T-lymphocyte count) and a dependent variable (e.g., DLBCL risk). In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk depends on the value of the independent variable. Here, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is stronger among patients with lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, suggesting that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count."}

Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor which prevents the HIV from entering host cells thereby stopping the virus from replicating within the body. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation like other antiretroviral drugs. Dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine are all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which prevent the intracellular formation of viral DNA by binding to reverse transcriptase. Efavirenz is also an NNRTI but requires intracellular phosphorylation. Ritonavir and raltegravir are both integrase inhibitors, which prevent the integration of the viral DNA into the host cell genome; they do not affect viral DNA synthesis.

He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?\nA: He will not be able to plantar flex his foot.\nB: He will not be able to point his toe.\nC: He will have a foot drop.\nD: He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.\nE: He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.", "predict_answer": "This patient has sustained a fracture of the calcaneus which is the heel bone in the bottom of the foot. The calcaneus is responsible for supporting the arch of the foot and assisting in inversion and eversion movements. Surgery involves repair of the fractured bone using screws and would involve some degree of soft tissue damage/reconstruction as well. This would likely result in some degree of weakness or paralysis of the Achilles tendon which is responsible for dorsiflexion (lifting of the foot) and plantar flexion (curtailing of the foot) of the foot.\nTherefore, the correct option is E: He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot."}

{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead.

{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?\nA: Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma\nB: Dissection of an intracerebral vessel\nC: Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses\nD: Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm\nE: Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles", "predict_answer": "The correct answer should be C. Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses can cause headaches. This is less likely to be the case since there were no nasal symptoms and the sinuses were palpated without causing pain. The other options are unlikely because they involve more serious pathology such as bleeding, dissection, or tumor growth."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 70-year-old man presents with cough and progressively worsening shortness of breath for the last 6 months. He feels short of breath even without exertion and states he ‘got winded’ while walking to his bedroom last night. He describes his cough as non-productive and says he can identify no recognizable triggers. No significant past medical history. The patient is a retired welder and has been living with his son since his wife passed away 5 years ago. He denies any smoking history or current alcohol or drug use. His vital signs include: pulse rate 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 134/80 mm Hg, and temperature 36.8°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, digital clubbing is noted. Bilateral basilar fine crackles on noted on pulmonary auscultation. Expiratory flow rates are measured and found to be high when corrected for lung volume. A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?\nA: Anatomical dead space\nB: Lung compliance\nC: Physiological dead space\nD: Radial traction on airway wall\nE: Small airway wall thickness\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Radial traction on airway wall", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is 'B: Lung compliance'.\nLung compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and contract easily with changes in air pressure. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the airways become stiff and rigid, leading to decreased lung compliance. This results in decreased expiratory flow rates because it takes more effort to expel air from the lungs. In this case, the high expiratory flow rates observed in the patient are consistent with increased lung compliance, which would be expected in a patient with COPD."}
