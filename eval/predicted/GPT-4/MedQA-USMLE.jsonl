The patient's episode of loss of consciousness occurred in a setting that is commonly associated with vasovagal syncope (being seated and receiving a tattoo, which can be a painful and stressful stimulus). The description of her becoming diaphoretic and pale before passing out is also consistent with vasovagal syncope, which is often preceded by such prodromal symptoms due to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leading to cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\nThe brief duration of unconsciousness, the rapid return to full orientation, and the absence of a serious medical history further support this diagnosis. The jerky movements described by the boyfriend could be misinterpreted as seizure activity, but such movements can also occur during a syncopal episode due to cerebral hypoperfusion (convulsive syncope).\n\nThe incomplete right bundle branch block on the ECG is an incidental finding and does not necessarily indicate a cardiac arrhythmia or structural abnormality as the primary cause of her syncope, especially in the context of a normal cardiopulmonary examination and the absence of any history suggesting a cardiac etiology.\n\nOrthostatic syncope (B) typically occurs upon standing, not while seated. Tonic-clonic seizure (C) is less likely given the rapid recovery and lack of postictal symptoms.

Prolactinomas are benign tumors of the pituitary gland that secrete excessive amounts of prolactin. High levels of prolactin inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn decreases the secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. This inhibition of gonadotropins leads to a disruption of the normal menstrual cycle, resulting in amenorrhea.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation:\n\nA: Excessive production of androgens would more likely present with signs of virilization, such as hirsutism or acne, which are not mentioned in the case.\n\nC: Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation, or Asherman's syndrome, would not explain the galactorrhea or visual field defects.\n\nD: Nondisjunction of chromosomes is a genetic anomaly that leads to conditions such as Down syndrome or Turner syndrome, which are not related to the patient's current symptoms.\n\nE: Nutritional imbalance can cause amenorrhea, but it would not explain the galactorrhea or visual field defects.\n\nThe presence of a pituitary adenoma is further supported by the recent history of headaches, which could be due to the tumor's mass effect, and the temporal field visual defects, which are characteristic of a lesion affecting the optic chiasm, such as a pituitary adenoma."}

This means that it is assumed that the parents would consent to necessary treatment if they were available, especially in a life-threatening situation.\n\nThe 14-year-old brother is not legally able to provide consent for the surgery, and obtaining a court order (C) would take too much time in an emergency situation. Delaying surgery (E) could be detrimental to the child's health and is not appropriate when immediate surgery is indicated. Consent from the patient (B) is not applicable as the patient is a minor and lacks the capacity to consent.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform the emergency laparotomy to address the likely surgical cause of the child's symptoms and to prevent further deterioration of his condition."}

The presence of hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, along with an increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, points towards a disorder of calcium metabolism.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the autonomous overproduction of PTH, which leads to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, and is a common cause of calcium stone formation. The symptoms of fatigue and constipation can also be associated with hypercalcemia. The absence of a secondary cause (such as chronic kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency) for the increased PTH rules out secondary hyperparathyroidism. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism typically occurs in patients with a history of long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is not indicated in this patient's history.\n\nPseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism are genetic disorders affecting the PTH receptors or Gs protein signaling, and they are not associated with hypercalcemia or increased PTH levels. In fact, pseudohypoparathyroidism is characterized by hypocalcemia and increased PTH due to end-organ resistance to PTH.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms and laboratory findings is primary hyperparathyroidism."}

In CKD, the kidneys are less able to excrete phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia, and less able to produce the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol). This results in hypocalcemia, which in turn stimulates the parathyroid glands to produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism can lead to disturbances in bone metabolism, including osteitis fibrosa cystica, which can result in bone pain and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra seen in the x-ray. The patient's calcium level is on the lower end of normal, which is consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, where you might not see the high calcium levels typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n\nA: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is autonomous production of PTH after a long period of secondary hyperparathyroidism, typically in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, there is no evidence of hypercalcemia, which would suggest tertiary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nC: Elder abuse could potentially cause a fracture, but it would not explain the patient's chronic kidney disease or the biochemical findings.\n\nD: Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a genetic disorder characterized by end-organ resistance to PTH, not relevant to this patient's presentation.\n\nE: Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia due to autonomous overproduction of PTH, which is not the case here as the patient's calcium level is not elevated."}

The high reticulocyte count, along with jaundice, suggests hemolysis.\n\nGiven the maternal blood group is O, Rh-negative with a positive anti-Rh antibody titer, and the fetal blood group is B, Rh-negative, the most likely cause of hemolysis is Rh incompatibility. Even though the baby is Rh-negative, the presence of maternal anti-Rh antibodies suggests that the mother has been sensitized to the Rh antigen in the past, likely during her previous pregnancy with her first child who may be Rh-positive. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of the fetal red blood cells in subsequent pregnancies, even if the fetus is Rh-negative, due to the immune memory cells that can react to the Rh antigen.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out based on the information provided:\n\nA: RBC enzyme deficiency (such as G6PD deficiency) could cause jaundice and hemolysis, but there is no specific evidence pointing to this, and it would not explain the maternal antibodies.\n\nB: RBC sickling is associated with sickle cell disease, but the newborn's blood type and the presence of maternal antibodies suggest an immune cause rather than a genetic one like sickle cell.\n\nD: Biliary duct malformation could cause jaundice due to direct bilirubin elevation, but the direct bilirubin is normal in this case.\n\nE: Anti-B antibodies would not be the cause since the mother is type O and would not have anti-B antibodies, and the baby is type B, Rh-negative, which would not typically cause a reaction in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the presence of maternal anti-Rh antibodies and the clinical presentation of hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh incompatibility is the most likely explanation for the newborn's condition."}

However, the description of the mass as firm, non-tender, and immobile raises the concern for a possible neoplastic process, despite the patient's history of normal Pap smears.\n\nGiven the abnormal finding on the pelvic examination, the next best step in management would be to perform a colposcopy and biopsy (C). This would allow for direct visualization of the cervix using a colposcope and the opportunity to take a biopsy of the mass for histopathological examination. This is important to rule out any potential malignancy, especially given the patient's history of smoking, which is a risk factor for cervical cancer.\n\nThe other options are less appropriate given the current clinical scenario:\n\nA: No further intervention would not be appropriate given the abnormal finding on examination.\n\nB: Electrocautery and cryofreezing are treatment modalities that may be used for certain cervical lesions, but it would be premature to treat a lesion before obtaining a definitive diagnosis.\n\nD: Administration of oral contraceptives is not indicated in this scenario as there is no mention of hormonal imbalance or conditions that would benefit from hormonal therapy.\n\nE: Administration of antibiotics would be indicated if there was evidence of an infection, which is not suggested by the history or examination findings in this case."}

The absence of bowel changes makes gastrointestinal causes less likely, and the lack of mention of systemic symptoms such as weight loss or fever makes malignancy less likely, though not impossible.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA: Rectouterine septum nodularity is typically associated with endometriosis, which could explain dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, but it is less likely to cause a significantly enlarged uterus or heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nB: Globular 10-week sized uterus could be consistent with a fibroid uterus. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus and are common in women of reproductive age. They can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, a sensation of pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency due to pressure on the bladder.\n\nC: Adnexal mass would suggest something originating from the ovaries or fallopian tubes, such as an ovarian cyst or tumor, which might not directly cause heavy menstrual bleeding or an enlarged uterus.\n\nD: Irregular 14-week sized uterus could suggest adenomyosis or multiple fibroids, which can cause heavy and painful periods, as well as an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n\nE: No remarkable physical exam finding is less likely given the patient's significant symptoms.\n\nBased on the patient's presentation, the most likely physical exam finding would be a globular enlarged uterus, which is consistent with the presence of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: Globular 10-week sized uterus\n\nFibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age and can cause the symptoms described. The \"10-week sized uterus\" description is a way to convey the size of the uterus as it would be at 10 weeks of gestation, which is a common method of describing uterine enlargement due to fibroids."}

The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the blood culture is a significant finding, as this organism is a common cause of IE, especially in intravenous drug users.\n\nThe diagnosis of IE is often confirmed by demonstrating persistent bacteremia through multiple blood cultures and by echocardiography to visualize vegetations on the heart valves or other endocardial surfaces.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis would be:\n\nA: Repeat blood cultures now.\n\nThis is because once a blood culture is positive for Staphylococcus aureus, it is important to establish whether there is ongoing bacteremia, which is a criterion for IE. Repeating blood cultures immediately can help determine if the bacteremia is persistent, which is a characteristic of IE. Additionally, obtaining serial blood cultures can help in monitoring the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy.\n\nThe other options suggesting to wait 24, 36, or 48 hours are less appropriate because they delay the potential confirmation and ongoing assessment of the infection, which is critical in a disease like IE that can rapidly progress and lead to serious complications.\n\nOption E, not to repeat blood cultures, is not appropriate because it would not allow for the assessment of persistent bacteremia, which is necessary for the diagnosis and management of IE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Repeat blood cultures now."}

A low C-peptide level indicates that the insulin in her system is not endogenously produced (since C-peptide is released in equimolar amounts with endogenous insulin). An insulinoma, choice A, would typically present with high insulin and C-peptide levels due to endogenous overproduction.\n\nHer Hgb A1c is normal (5.1%), which suggests that she does not have chronic hyperglycemia and, by extension, likely not diabetes. This makes chronic conditions like alimentary hypoglycemia (choice C) less likely, as this condition is often seen post-gastric surgery and is associated with postprandial hypoglycemia, not fasting hypoglycemia.\n\nHypothyroidism (choice D) can cause hypoglycemia but is usually associated with other metabolic abnormalities and symptoms that are not described in the scenario.\n\nSomatization disorder (choice E) involves the presentation of physical symptoms that are not explained by a medical condition, which is not the case here since the patient's hypoglycemia is a real and measurable medical condition.\n\nThe patient's difficult divorce and the stress of that situation could suggest a psychological component to her presentation. Factitious disorder involves intentionally fabricating or inducing symptoms for the role of a patient.

The increased serum gastrin levels and inflammation of the gastric body and fundus seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy suggest a problem with the stomach's acid-producing cells, as gastrin is a hormone that stimulates acid secretion.\n\nIn the context of hypothyroidism, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is autoimmune gastritis, which is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of hypothyroidism). Autoimmune gastritis leads to chronic inflammation and the destruction of parietal cells, which are responsible for the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The loss of parietal cells leads to achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid), which causes an increase in gastrin levels as the body attempts to stimulate acid production.

At this level of CD4 count, the patient is at high risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV/AIDS. The standard prophylaxis for PCP in patients with CD4 counts below 200/mm3 is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).\n\nWhile the patient refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy, which is the primary treatment to restore immune function and prevent opportunistic infections, it is still important to provide prophylaxis against these infections. TMP-SMX also provides some prophylactic coverage against Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis, another opportunistic infection that can occur in patients with CD4 counts below 100/mm3.\n\nThe other options listed include medications for prophylaxis against different opportunistic infections, but TMP-SMX is the most appropriate choice given the patient's CD4 count and the need for PCP prophylaxis. Azithromycin is used for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis in patients with CD4 counts below 50/mm3, but TMP-SMX is the priority in this case.

This condition is characterized by dry, scaly skin that often worsens in the winter and improves in the summer due to the effects of humidity and sun exposure. The absence of itching, redness, or discharge also points away from inflammatory conditions like psoriasis (A) or eczematous conditions like lichen simplex (B). The presence of scales without inflammation and the sparing of skin creases are typical for ichthyosis vulgaris. Additionally, the description of papular elevations at the base of hair follicles suggests the presence of keratosis pilaris, which commonly occurs in association with ichthyosis vulgaris. The darkening of palmar and plantar creases is another feature supporting this diagnosis.\n\nPityriasis versicolor (D) typically presents with hypo- or hyperpigmented patches with fine scaling, often on the trunk, and is caused by a yeast infection, which does not match the generalized scaling described.\n\nX-linked ichthyosis (E) could present with similar scaling, but it is less common than ichthyosis vulgaris and usually presents earlier in infancy.

Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?\nA: Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin\nB: Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin\nC: Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\nD: Decreases levels of HgbS\nE: Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "C: Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)", "predict_answer": "C: Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\n\nHydroxyurea is used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia because it has been shown to increase the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF). HgbF has a higher affinity for oxygen than the defective hemoglobin S (HgbS) and does not sickle under normal physiological conditions. By increasing HgbF levels, hydroxyurea reduces the proportion of HgbS in the red blood cells and thus decreases the sickling and subsequent complications associated with sickle cell anemia."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?\nA: Bilateral mydriasis\nB: Bilateral miosis\nC: Miosis of the right eye only\nD: Miosis of the left eye only\nE: Mydriasis of the left eye\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Bilateral miosis", "predict_answer": "The correct answer is C: Miosis of the right eye only.\n\nThis patient's symptoms suggest a possible issue with the afferent pathway of the left eye, given the lack of vision and no pupillary response when light is shone in the left eye. The afferent pathway involves the optic nerve and the retinal ganglion cells, which are responsible for detecting light and sending the signal to the brain.\n\nWhen light is shone in a healthy eye, the normal response is constriction of the pupil in that eye (direct response) and constriction of the pupil in the other eye (consensual response). This is due to the consensual light reflex, where the afferent pathway of one eye sends signals to both sides of the brain, and the efferent pathways cause both pupils to constrict.\n\nIn this case, shining a light in the left eye does not produce a response, indicating a problem with the afferent pathway of the left eye. However, when light is shone in the right eye, the afferent pathway of the right eye is intact, and the brain will send signals to constrict both pupils. Since the left eye has an afferent defect, there will be no response in that eye, but the right eye, which is healthy, will constrict. Hence, you would expect miosis (constriction) of the right eye only.\n\nThe patient needs immediate further evaluation to determine the cause of the afferent pupillary defect, often referred to as a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which could be due to optic neuritis, retinal detachment, or another serious ocular condition. Given her history of SLE, there could be an autoimmune component to her eye condition."}

{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?\nA: Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.\nB: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\nC: The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\nD: The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\nE: The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.", "predict_answer": "B: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Incidence rates refer to the number of new cases that develop in a population during a specific time period. The length of the time period should not affect the rate of new cases unless the underlying risk of developing the disease changes over time. If the risk remains constant, the incidence rate should be consistent regardless of the time period length.\n\nA: Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Prevalence is a measure of all existing cases (new and pre-existing) at a given point in time or over a specific time period. If you examine a longer time period, you would expect to find more cases, not fewer, so the prevalence estimate would likely be higher, not lower.\n\nC: The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Prevalence is the proportion of individuals with a condition at a specific time. Shorter time windows would not inherently lead to an overestimation of prevalence. However, if the time window is too short to capture the full extent of existing cases (because not all patients with SLE will have contact with the healthcare system during that window), it could lead to an underestimation.\n\nD: The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Attack rates are a measure similar to incidence rates but are typically used for diseases that are closely monitored for a short duration, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases. Including attack rates would not be relevant for a chronic disease like SLE, and it would not necessarily increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n\nE: The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect for the same reasons as D. Attack rates are not typically used in the context of chronic diseases like SLE, and their inclusion would not necessarily decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n\nThe relationship between incidence and prevalence is such that prevalence can be thought of as a function of the incidence rate and the duration of the disease. Prevalence will increase if the incidence rate goes up or if the duration of the disease is extended (e.g., due to better treatments). Conversely, prevalence will decrease if the incidence rate goes down or if the duration of the disease is shortened (e.g., due to higher mortality).\n\nNone of the statements provided accurately describe the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates in the context of the study described. The correct relationship is that if the incidence remains constant, the prevalence will increase over time as more individuals accumulate in the prevalent pool. If the incidence increases, the prevalence will increase even more quickly, assuming the duration of the disease does not change. If the incidence decreases, the prevalence will increase more slowly or could potentially decrease if the disease duration is also decreasing."}

She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg.

{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?\nA: Lack of a comparison group\nB: No prevalence assessment\nC: Low number of patients\nD: Ascertainment bias\nE: Lack of risk calculation\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "E: Lack of risk calculation", "predict_answer": "A: Lack of a comparison group\n\nThe key difference between a cohort study and a case series is the presence of a comparison group. A cohort study typically observes a group of individuals with a certain exposure or treatment and compares them to a group without the exposure or treatment to determine the effect. Since the editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series, it is likely because there was no comparison group in the study. The study focused on a group of patients who all received the same treatment (cerclage wiring) without comparing them to a control group that did not receive the treatment or received a different treatment. This is why the editor would suggest reclassifying it as a case series, which is a descriptive study that tracks patients with a known exposure or treatment but does not have a comparison (control) group."}

{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉).

However, the absence of focal neurologic symptoms, pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and meningeal symptoms make a chronic subdural hematoma (A), intracerebral vessel dissection (B), and a growing intracranial neoplasm (D) less likely. Additionally, the painless palpation of the paranasal sinuses makes sinus pressure (C) an unlikely cause.\n\nThe fact that the headache is worse in the morning an hour after breakfast and medication intake could suggest that the headache is related to the effects of the medications or to changes in blood pressure. The patient's use of isosorbide mononitrate, which is a vasodilator used to treat angina, could lead to dilation of intracerebral arterioles, causing headaches. This type of headache is known as a nitrate headache and is a common side effect of nitrates due to their vasodilatory properties.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism for this patient's headache is the dilation of intracerebral arterioles (E), potentially related to her use of isosorbide mononitrate."}

In restrictive lung diseases, lung compliance is often increased due to lung fibrosis, which makes the lungs stiffer and less able to expand. However, this stiffness can actually increase the speed at which air is expelled from the lungs up to a certain point, as the recoil of the lung tissue helps to push air out.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB: Lung compliance\n\nIn the context of the question, increased lung compliance due to fibrosis would lead to increased expiratory flow rates.
