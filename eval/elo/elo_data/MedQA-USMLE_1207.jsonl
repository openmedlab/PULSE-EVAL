Oral mifepristone followed by misoprostol is a safe and effective method for terminating an early pregnancy. It is a noninvasive option that allows the patient to terminate the pregnancy in the privacy of her own home.\n\nOptions A and D (Dilatation and evacuation (D&E) and Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation) are more invasive surgical procedures that are typically performed later in the pregnancy.

This is highly suggestive of a fibroadenoma, which is a benign breast mass. Fibroadenomas are common, noncancerous masses that can occur in both males and females, and are more common in women of reproductive age. They are usually palpable, mobile, and asymptomatic, and are typically less than 2 cm in diameter. Fibroadenomas are usually not painful and do not change in size or shape, but they can enlarge or become tender during pregnancy, menopause, or menstruation. They can also be associated with an inherited genetic condition called Carcinoma Familialis. The patient’s grandmother has invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which is a type of invasive breast cancer. Carcinoma Familialis is an inherited genetic condition that increases the risk of breast cancer in the affected individuals. The patient is an avid softball player, which may increase her risk of breast cancer in the future. However, this is not a definitive risk factor, and other factors such as age, family history, and lifestyle habits are also important. The patient denies any discharge or skin changes, and there is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. These findings are consistent with a benign mass.

The fact that the left knee was swollen a few weeks ago and now both knees are affected, and the patient's report that his pain significantly improves with rest, are also consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. The other options are less likely because they typically present with other symptoms such as fever, rash, or positive family history. Psoriatic arthritis often affects the hands and feet as well as the joints, and the patient's nail pitting is not a typical finding. Arthritis mutilans typically presents with joint pain and swelling that worsens with movement, and the patient's report of improved pain with rest is not consistent with this condition. Familial Mediterranean fever is a rare genetic condition that typically affects middle-aged adults and is characterized by fever, headache, and muscle pain, and the patient's symptoms do not fit this pattern. Mixed connective tissue disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect many different parts of the body, but the patient's symptoms are not typical of this condition."}

There has been no recent contact with any animals or pets. The temperature is 38.6℃ (101.5℉), the pulse is 78/min, the respiration rate is 12/min, and the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise.

It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with excellent activity against Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with plague.\n\nAzithromycin may also be effective for the treatment of plague, but streptomycin is preferred in this case due to the severity of the symptoms and the presence of buboes. Imipenem and chloramphenicol are other possible treatments, but they are not the first-line choices for bubonic plague. No pharmacotherapy is not an appropriate option, as prompt antibiotic treatment is crucial in cases of plague.

Asthma exacerbations often occur when a patient’s airways become inflamed, which can be caused by a number of factors, including viral infections, exposure to allergens, and stress. In addition to the symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath, patients with asthma exacerbations may also experience fever, tachycardia, and/or increased respiratory secretions. In such cases, it is important to adjust the patient’s treatment regimen to help manage the exacerbation. The addition of salmeterol, which is a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), can be particularly helpful in the management of asthma exacerbations. LABAs are often used in combination with corticosteroids to help control asthma symptoms on a daily basis. However, in the setting of an exacerbation, LABAs can help to quickly open up the airways and improve breathing. It is also important to note that LABAs can be administered twice daily to help manage symptoms on a daily basis. Additionally, in the setting of an exacerbation, it is important to use a rapid-relief inhaler (such as albuterol) to help quickly open up the airways in the event of an acute attack. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), add salmeterol twice daily."}

This results in air trapping and an increase in the residual volume (the amount of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation). The destruction of alveolar walls also reduces the surface area for gas exchange and impairs the airflow, especially during expiration, leading to a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). \n\nTherefore, the most likely findings in this patient would be an increased residual volume due to air trapping and a decreased FEV1 due to airflow limitation, which corresponds to option C.", "model_b_predict_answer": "C: Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume\n\nThe patient's history and physical exam findings are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is most commonly caused by smoking.

The presence of scales without inflammation and the sparing of skin creases are typical for ichthyosis vulgaris. Additionally, the description of papular elevations at the base of hair follicles suggests the presence of keratosis pilaris, which commonly occurs in association with ichthyosis vulgaris. The darkening of palmar and plantar creases is another feature supporting this diagnosis.\n\nPityriasis versicolor (D) typically presents with hypo- or hyperpigmented patches with fine scaling, often on the trunk, and is caused by a yeast infection, which does not match the generalized scaling described.\n\nX-linked ichthyosis (E) could present with similar scaling, but it is less common than ichthyosis vulgaris and usually presents earlier in infancy.

Adding fluticasone to the patient's treatment regimen will help to reduce airway inflammation and improve asthma control. It is important to address the underlying inflammation in patients with persistent asthma, especially with symptoms that are impacting the patient's daily activities and quality of life. Adding cromolyn prior to exercise may be beneficial, but it does not address the patient's overall poorly controlled asthma.

The high reticulocyte count, along with jaundice, suggests hemolysis.\n\nGiven the maternal blood group is O, Rh-negative with a positive anti-Rh antibody titer, and the fetal blood group is B, Rh-negative, the most likely cause of hemolysis is Rh incompatibility. Even though the baby is Rh-negative, the presence of maternal anti-Rh antibodies suggests that the mother has been sensitized to the Rh antigen in the past, likely during her previous pregnancy with her first child who may be Rh-positive.

Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?\nA: Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.\nB: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\nC: The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\nD: The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\nE: The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "B: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.", "model_a": "GPT-4", "model_b": "ChatGLM3", "model_a_predict_answer": "B: Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Incidence rates refer to the number of new cases that develop in a population during a specific time period. The length of the time period should not affect the rate of new cases unless the underlying risk of developing the disease changes over time. If the risk remains constant, the incidence rate should be consistent regardless of the time period length.\n\nA: Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Prevalence is a measure of all existing cases (new and pre-existing) at a given point in time or over a specific time period. If you examine a longer time period, you would expect to find more cases, not fewer, so the prevalence estimate would likely be higher, not lower.\n\nC: The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Prevalence is the proportion of individuals with a condition at a specific time. Shorter time windows would not inherently lead to an overestimation of prevalence. However, if the time window is too short to capture the full extent of existing cases (because not all patients with SLE will have contact with the healthcare system during that window), it could lead to an underestimation.\n\nD: The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Attack rates are a measure similar to incidence rates but are typically used for diseases that are closely monitored for a short duration, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases. Including attack rates would not be relevant for a chronic disease like SLE, and it would not necessarily increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n\nE: The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect for the same reasons as D. Attack rates are not typically used in the context of chronic diseases like SLE, and their inclusion would not necessarily decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n\nThe relationship between incidence and prevalence is such that prevalence can be thought of as a function of the incidence rate and the duration of the disease. Prevalence will increase if the incidence rate goes up or if the duration of the disease is extended (e.g., due to better treatments). Conversely, prevalence will decrease if the incidence rate goes down or if the duration of the disease is shortened (e.g., due to higher mortality).\n\nNone of the statements provided accurately describe the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates in the context of the study described. The correct relationship is that if the incidence remains constant, the prevalence will increase over time as more individuals accumulate in the prevalent pool. If the incidence increases, the prevalence will increase even more quickly, assuming the duration of the disease does not change. If the incidence decreases, the prevalence will increase more slowly or could potentially decrease if the disease duration is also decreasing.", "model_b_predict_answer": "This is a classic case of the \"incident/prevalence bias\" and is a common problem in studies that use hospital records to estimate incidence and prevalence rates. The reason for this bias is that patients who have a new diagnosis of SLE during a short time window are more likely to have the disease than those who have the disease for a long time. This is because the earlier the diagnosis, the more likely the disease is to be a true new diagnosis and not just a recurrence. The reverse is also true, i.e. patients with a long history of SLE are more likely to have the disease than those who have it for a short time. Therefore, the prevalence estimates will be overestimated if only the short time windows are used. This is the same bias as the \"attack rate bias\" where only the attack rates are used, rather than the true rates of incidence and prevalence. This bias is corrected by using long time periods."}

The digital clubbing also suggests long-standing hypoxemia, which is a common finding in COPD patients. The chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, which is a common finding in COPD patients due to chronic air trapping. Therefore, the combination of physical examination findings and the chest X-ray suggests that this patient has COPD, which is causing the increased expiratory flow rate due to physiological dead space."}

Additionally, the fact that the patient has had arthritis for 16 years suggests a chronic condition. Pitting of the nails, also known as \"ungual infolding,\" is a common finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Psoriatic Arthritis is also a possibility, but it typically affects the distal joints and has a different pattern of nail involvement. Arthritis mutilans is a subtype of Rheumatoid Arthritis that is characterized by deformity and destruction of the joints, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest this. Familial Mediterranean Fever is a genetic condition that causes recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain, and is not typically associated with joint symptoms. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease is a condition that affects multiple organ systems, and is not typically associated with joint swelling and pain. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Rheumatoid Arthritis.", "model_b_predict_answer": "The most likely diagnosis for the 67-year-old man with arthritis, knee swelling, back pain, and pitting of the nails is C: Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects the small joints in the hands and feet, but can also involve larger joints such as the knees. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, and can lead to joint damage and deformities if not properly managed. The fact that the patient has had arthritis for 16 years and is now experiencing swelling and pain in both knees suggests a systemic autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the presence of back pain and the improvement of pain with rest are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (A) is a possibility given the patient's dandruff, but the involvement of the nails is more indicative of rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis mutilans (B) is a severe and rare form of psoriatic arthritis which leads to the destruction of the joints, but the presentation in this case is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Familial Mediterranean fever (D) typically presents with recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain, and is less likely in this case. Mixed connective tissue disease (E) involves symptoms of various connective tissue disorders, but the patient's presentation is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?\nA: Drug-induced hypokalemia\nB: Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin\nC: Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme\nD: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\nE: Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Inhibition of P-glycoprotein", "model_a": "ChatGPT", "model_b": "PULSE-OS", "model_a_predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Drug-induced hypokalemia.\n\nThe development of digoxin toxicity in this patient is most likely due to drug-induced hypokalemia. Digoxin toxicity is known to be potentiated by hypokalemia, and the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness are consistent with digoxin toxicity.\n\nLow-dose aspirin, verapamil, and digoxin are all known to cause hypokalemia. Aspirin can increase renal excretion of potassium, verapamil can cause gastrointestinal potassium loss, and digoxin itself can lead to hypokalemia. The combination of these medications may have led to the development of hypokalemia, which in turn has potentiated the toxic effects of digoxin.\n\nGiven the patient's history of heart failure, he may also be at increased risk for developing hypokalemia due to the use of diuretics, which can lead to potassium loss.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism of development of digitalis toxicity in this patient is drug-induced hypokalemia.", "model_b_predict_answer": "The correct answer is A: Drug-induced hypokalemia.\n\nDigitalis toxicity can occur due to a variety of mechanisms, but one of the most common is drug-induced hypokalemia. In this case, the patient has been taking digoxin for a year and has recently started taking verapamil, which is known to increase the risk of digitalis toxicity by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein efflux pump in the gut, leading to increased intestinal absorption of digoxin. However, the patient's serum digoxin level is within the therapeutic range, suggesting that the toxicity is not due to increased absorption. The other mechanisms listed (C, D, and E) are not relevant to this case. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the digitalis toxicity is drug-induced hypokalemia, which can occur as a side effect of digoxin therapy and cause cardiac toxicity. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness are consistent with digitalis toxicity, and the low serum potassium level would support this diagnosis. It is important to correct the hypokalemia and discontinue or adjust the digoxin and verapamil therapy as appropriate to prevent further toxicity."}

This involves collecting a sample of skin scraping from the affected area and placing it on a microscope slide, then adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the slide and observing it under a microscope for the presence of fungal elements. This is a simple and quick test that can provide a definitive diagnosis. Localized ultrasound, Gram stain, and AFB stain are not typically used to diagnose fungal infections and are not appropriate for this case. Nikolsky's sign, which is the presence of fungal elements on the skin surface after applying pressure to the affected area, is not specific to Tinea cruris and can also be seen in other fungal infections, bacterial infections, and some autoimmune diseases, so it is not a confirmatory test.", "model_b_predict_answer": "B: KOH examination of lesion scrapings\n\nThe suspected diagnosis in this case is tinea cruris, also known as jock itch.

The fact that the patient was recently in northern Maine, an area where Lyme disease is endemic, and spent most of her time outdoors increases the likelihood of exposure to infected ticks.\n\nTicks that carry the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, are commonly found in the northeastern and north-central United States, including Maine. Tsetse flies, Culicidae, and Dermacentor variabilis are not known to transmit Lyme disease.\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, which are commonly found in wooded and grassy areas. The tick must be attached for at least 36-48 hours before the bacteria can be transmitted, so it's important for individuals in endemic areas to take precautions such as wearing protective clothing, using tick repellent, and performing tick checks after spending time outdoors. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more severe symptoms, including arthritis, meningitis, and cardiac and neurological problems.\n\nIt's important for the patient to seek medical attention promptly for appropriate diagnosis and treatment, which may include antibiotics to prevent further complications."}

This means that if the diameter of a vessel is reduced to half, the resistance to blood flow will increase by the fourth power of 2, or 16 times. Therefore, if the left circumflex artery has a 50% reduction in diameter, the resistance to blood flow will increase by a factor of 16^4, or 4096, which is approximately equal to 4.\n\nSo the resistance to blood flow in the occluded artery is 4 times greater than in a non-occluded artery with the same length and flow rate.

The timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications because colesevelam is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is an inhibitor of CYP2D6, which is the metabolic pathway responsible for the metabolism of hydrochlorothiazide, albuterol, and oral contraceptives. This can lead to increased plasma concentrations of these medications and potentially increase the risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to separate the dosing of colesevelam from the dosing of these other medications. The other options are incorrect. Colesevelam does not cause significant flushing or itching. It does not cause cognitive impairment or increase the risk of cholelithiasis. It also does not significantly decrease HDL.", "model_b_predict_answer": "D: Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.\n\nThe concern with initiating colesevelam (Welchol) in this patient is the potential for drug interactions, specifically with the other medications she is currently taking. Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that is used to lower cholesterol levels. It is important to separate the timing of colesevelam administration from other medications, particularly those that are also administered orally, as colesevelam can decrease the absorption of these medications. This is because colesevelam is taken orally and works by binding to bile acids in the gut, which can lead to reduced absorption of other orally administered medications. Therefore, it is important to space out the administration of colesevelam from other medications by at least 4-5 hours to minimize the risk of drug interactions. The patient's other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, and albuterol, should be taken at least 4-5 hours before or after colesevelam to ensure optimal absorption and therapeutic effect. The other options listed are not major concerns with initiating colesevelam in this patient."}

The pons is a part of the brainstem that plays a vital role in controlling eye movement, and a tumor in this area can cause double vision, difficulty in moving the eyes laterally, and nystagmus. The hyperemia seen on fundoscopy may also be related to the increased intracranial pressure caused by the tumor. The other options are less likely because demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus typically causes difficulty with horizontal eye movements, not vertical eye movements, and subdural hematoma would typically cause more severe symptoms such as headache, confusion, and weakness. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency is unlikely given the patient's normal vital signs and lack of other symptoms of thiamine deficiency. Infarction of the brainstem would typically cause more widespread symptoms than just those involving the eyes.

The null hypothesis is that there is no association between low birth weight and obesity. The researcher has conducted a study with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value of 0.049, and has rejected the null hypothesis. This means that the researcher has concluded that there is a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity.\n\nHowever, the confidence interval is 95%, which means that there is a 5% chance of a type 2 error (i.e., concluding that there is an association when there is no true association). The p-value of 0.049 is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, which means that the researcher may have incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D: A type 2 error has been made.\n\nA type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, resulting in concluding that there is an association when there is no true association. This can happen when the sample size is too small, the significance level is too low, or the confidence interval is too narrow. In this case, the confidence interval of 95% may be too narrow, which increases the chance of a type 2 error.

This means that there is a 4.9% chance that the observed association could be due to random chance rather than a true effect. Since the p-value is close to the threshold, there is still a relatively high risk of committing a type 1 error. The other options are not correct because:\n\nA: The confidence interval being 90% would make the results less stringent, not more.

It can be bilateral or unilateral depending on the affected part of the iris.  The iris is composed of two parts, the choroid and the sclera.  The choroid is the colored part of the iris and the sclera is the white part of the iris.  The choroid is responsible for determining the size of the pupil.  The sclera is responsible for determining the shape of the pupil.  The choroid is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system and the sclera is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are antagonistic to each other.  The sympathetic system is responsible for constricting the pupil and the parasympathetic system is responsible for dialating the pupil.  The mydriatic effect of the sympathetic system is greater than that of the parasympathetic system.\n\n The parasympathetic fibers are responsible for dialating the pupil.  The parasympathetic fibers originate from the ciliary ganglion of the eye.  The sympathetic fibers are responsible for constricting the pupil.  The sympathetic fibers originate from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\nMiosis can be bilateral or unilateral depending on which part of the iris is affected.  If both parts of the iris are affected, the mydriatic effect is less.  If only one part of the iris is affected, the mydriatic effect is greater.\n\nMiosis can also be complete or partial.  If the iris is completely constricted, it is called complete miosis.  If the iris is partially constricted, it is called partial miosis.\n\nMiosis can also be transient or permanent.  Transient miosis is when the mydriatic effect is transient.  Permanent miosis is when the mydriatic effect is permanent.\n\nMiosis can also be general or local.  General miosis is when both parts of the iris are constricted.  Local miosis is when one part of the iris is constricted and the other part is dialated.\n\nMiosis can also be direct or indirect.  Direct miosis is when the iris is constricted directly.  Indirect miosis is when the iris is constricted indirectly.\n\nMiosis can also be natural or mechanical.  Natural miosis is when the iris is constricted by its own dialator muscle.  Mechanical miosis is when the iris is constricted by other than its own dialator muscle.\n\nMiosis can also be physiologic or pathologic.

It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, and can lead to joint damage and deformities if not properly managed. The fact that the patient has had arthritis for 16 years and is now experiencing swelling and pain in both knees suggests a systemic autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the presence of back pain and the improvement of pain with rest are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (A) is a possibility given the patient's dandruff, but the involvement of the nails is more indicative of rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis mutilans (B) is a severe and rare form of psoriatic arthritis which leads to the destruction of the joints, but the presentation in this case is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Familial Mediterranean fever (D) typically presents with recurrent episodes of fever and abdominal pain, and is less likely in this case. Mixed connective tissue disease (E) involves symptoms of various connective tissue disorders, but the patient's presentation is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency.

Colposcopy is a diagnostic technique that involves the use of a special microscope to examine the cervix and vagina. A biopsy is the removal of a small sample of tissue from the cyst for laboratory examination. The biopsy will confirm whether the cyst is benign or malignant. If the cyst is benign, no further intervention may be necessary. If the cyst is malignant, treatment options will depend on the stage of the cancer. If the cyst is malignant, the biopsy will also identify the stage of the cancer. If the cyst is not cancerous, the biopsy will confirm the diagnosis and allow for appropriate management.

This condition occurs when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D in the blood. The elevated PTH levels can cause bone turnover, leading to an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in bone density. This can result in the development of osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture seen on the X-ray of the spine. The patient's low hemoglobin, low calcium, and high phosphorus levels are also consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The pain in the lower back and radiating down the legs is likely caused by the compression of the spinal nerves due to the fracture.\n\nOption A (tertiary hyperparathyroidism) is not a recognized medical term, and option D (primary hyperparathyroidism) is less likely because it is usually associated with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, which are not seen in this patient.

There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA: Ulnar artery\nB: Extensor pollicis brevis tendon\nC: Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nD: Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nE: Ulnar nerve\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "C: Flexor pollicis longus tendon", "model_a": "DoctorGLM", "model_b": "PULSE-OS", "model_a_predict_answer": "你好，你的情况考虑为手腕痛，多为手腕的软组织或韧带受损，或受冷刺激引起的，可以采用按摩或热敷的方法缓解疼痛，必要时采用封闭治疗，注意术后护理，避免受冷刺激，定期复查。", "model_b_predict_answer": "Based on the given information, the correct answer is E: Ulnar nerve. The location of the painless lump near the left wrist and the associated tingling pain over the left hand suggests the possibility of ulnar nerve entrapment, which can occur at the wrist, where the ulnar nerve passes through the Guyon's canal, a narrow passage beneath the flexor carpi radialis tendon and behind the pisiform bone. The decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand also supports this possibility as the ulnar nerve innervates the muscles that control finger movements and sensation in these areas.\n\nThe ulnar artery (option A) and extensor pollicis brevis tendon (option B) are not at risk of entrapment in this case, as they are located on the other side of the wrist. The flexor pollicis longus tendon (option C) and flexor carpi radialis tendon (option D) are also not at risk of entrapment at the wrist, as they are located on the palmar side of the wrist.\n\nTherefore, the most likely structure at risk of entrapment if the mass persists is the ulnar nerve."}

It can be bilateral or unilateral depending on the affected part of the iris.  The iris is composed of two parts, the choroid and the sclera.  The choroid is the colored part of the iris and the sclera is the white part of the iris.  The choroid is responsible for determining the size of the pupil.  The sclera is responsible for determining the shape of the pupil.  The choroid is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system and the sclera is innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are antagonistic to each other.  The sympathetic system is responsible for constricting the pupil and the parasympathetic system is responsible for dialating the pupil.  The mydriatic effect of the sympathetic system is greater than that of the parasympathetic system.\n\n The parasympathetic fibers are responsible for dialating the pupil.  The parasympathetic fibers originate from the ciliary ganglion of the eye.  The sympathetic fibers are responsible for constricting the pupil.  The sympathetic fibers originate from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.\n\nMiosis can be bilateral or unilateral depending on which part of the iris is affected.

Demeclocycline, a medication the patient is taking for hyponatremia, is a tetracycline antibiotic known to cause phototoxic reactions. When the drug is activated by UV light, it can cause cell injury due to the formation of drug metabolites that damage cellular components, leading to the observed erythema and papular eruption.

Demeclocycline and amoxicillin are unlikely to contribute to this reaction as they are not known to cause photosensitivity. Mast cell degranulation (A) would cause anaphylaxis, not a contact dermatitis-like reaction; formation of drug-induced autoantibodies (B) would be more consistent with a drug eruption, but is unlikely here; accumulation of porphobilinogen (D) would cause porphyria cutanea tarda, which presents with a different clinical pattern; and cell injury due to drug metabolites (E) would be more consistent with a drug eruption, but is unlikely here given the timing of the reaction."}

In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk depends on the value of the independent variable.

The difference in the relationship between CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and DLBCL risk observed between the two strata is due to effect modification, which refers to the phenomenon where the relationship between an exposure and an outcome varies depending on the level of a third variable, such as CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in this case. In this study, the authors found that cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not among those with counts above 200/mm3. This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be modified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, meaning that the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different for patients with low and high CD4+ cell counts. This is an example of effect modification, where the effect of the exposure (cART adherence) differs depending on the level of the moderator (CD4+ T-lymphocyte count).", "model_b_predict_answer": "The difference in the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk between patients with low and high CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts could be explained by effect modification. Effect modification occurs when an exposure (e.g., cART adherence) modifies the relationship between an independent variable (e.g., CD4+ T-lymphocyte count) and a dependent variable (e.g., DLBCL risk). In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk depends on the value of the independent variable. Here, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is stronger among patients with lower CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, suggesting that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count."}

Additionally, he is having difficulty keeping up with his friends in the playground, suggesting that his asthma may be affecting his quality of life.\n\nFluticasone is a corticosteroid used to control asthma symptoms by reducing inflammation in the airways. It works to prevent the airway from becoming hyperresponsive to allergens and other triggers.

The presence of a rapid ventricular response in AF is often due to the loss of the normal atrioventricular (AV) nodal delay, which is necessary to prevent the rapid atrial rate from being conducted to the ventricles.\n\nAmiodarone is a medication that is often used to control the ventricular rate in patients with AF. It works by blocking multiple ion channels in the heart, including sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, which slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node and reduces the ventricular response rate. Therefore, the amiodarone blood level would have a strong positive correlation with this patient's heart rhythm, as it would be expected to slow down the rapid ventricular response seen in the ECG.\n\nThe other options are not as strongly correlated with the patient's heart rhythm:\n\nA: Digoxin blood level - Digoxin is also used to control the ventricular rate in AF, but it works by increasing the refractory period of the AV node, which is not as directly related to the ECG findings seen in this patient.\n\nB: PR interval - The PR interval is the time from the beginning of the P wave (atrial depolarization) to the beginning of the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization). In AF, the P waves are often absent or irregular, making the PR interval difficult to measure.\n\nC: QT interval - The QT interval represents the time from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave (ventricular repolarization). Prolongation of the QT interval can increase the risk of a dangerous arrhythmia called torsades de pointes, but it is not directly related to the rapid ventricular response seen in this patient's ECG.\n\nD: Age - While age can be a risk factor for AF, it is not directly related to the patient's heart rhythm in this case.\n\nE: Amiodarone blood level - As explained above, amiodarone blood level would have a strong positive correlation with this patient's heart rhythm."}

PCR is a technique used to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences, including those of viruses like HIV. In the case of a newborn baby, it can be used to detect the presence of HIV genetic material directly, regardless of whether the baby's immune system has produced antibodies against the virus. This makes it a more reliable method for early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants.\n\nHere's why the other options are not the best choice:\n\nA: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and C: Rapid HIV antibody test - These tests detect antibodies against HIV, not the virus itself. In a newborn, these tests can be unreliable because the baby may have inherited maternal antibodies, leading to a false positive result. It can take up to 18 months for these maternal antibodies to disappear, making it difficult to determine if the baby is truly infected.\n\nB: Western blot - This test is also used to detect antibodies against HIV and suffers from the same limitations as ELISA and rapid HIV antibody tests in newborns.\n\nE: Southern blot - This technique is used to detect and map specific DNA sequences, but it is not typically used for diagnostic purposes in clinical settings.

These medications work by inhibiting the activity of factor Xa, which is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Factor Xa is responsible for converting prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa), which is a crucial step in the formation of a blood clot. By inhibiting factor Xa, these medications prevent the formation of thrombin and thus reduce the risk of clot formation.\n\nThe patient's laboratory findings show a normal prothrombin time (PT) and an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The PT measures the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which involves factors VII, X, V, and II. The PTT measures the intrinsic pathway, which involves factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, and II. The normal PT indicates that the extrinsic pathway is functioning normally, while the elevated PTT suggests that the intrinsic pathway is affected.\n\nSince the patient is on DVT prophylaxis, which inhibits factor Xa, the most directly affected factor in the coagulation cascade is factor VIIa. Factor VIIa is the activated form of factor VII, which is part of the extrinsic pathway. The normal PT suggests that the extrinsic pathway is functioning normally, but the elevated PTT indicates that the intrinsic pathway is affected. This is consistent with the use of DVT prophylaxis, which inhibits factor Xa and thus affects the intrinsic pathway."}

The family history of a male relative requiring blood transfusions could suggest an X-linked condition. The blood work findings of normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin, along with the negative Coombs test and normal red blood cell osmotic fragility, point towards a non-immune hemolytic anemia.\n\nGiven the enzyme deficiency clue and the fact that the condition is related to metabolism and feeding, the most likely diagnosis is pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, and its deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia due to the inability of red blood cells to adequately produce ATP, leading to cell lysis.\n\nThe enzyme pyruvate kinase is allosterically inhibited by ATP, which signals an abundance of energy, thus slowing down glycolysis. However, ATP is not one of the options provided. Among the options given, alanine is known to be an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate kinase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: Alanine\n\nAlanine signals the abundance of building blocks for gluconeogenesis and the availability of energy, thus inhibiting glycolysis by allosterically inhibiting pyruvate kinase.", "model_b_predict_answer": "E: Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a condition called hereditary spherocytosis, which is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of spherical red blood cells (RBCs) on a peripheral blood smear. These spherical RBCs are more fragile than normal RBCs and can be easily destroyed, leading to hemolytic anemia.\n\nThe enzyme deficiency in question is likely pyruvate kinase, which is an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway responsible for generating ATP in RBCs. Pyruvate kinase deficiency leads to decreased ATP production, which impairs the ability of RBCs to maintain their shape and flexibility, resulting in spherocytosis.\n\nFructose 2,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase, meaning it increases the enzyme's activity. In the context of pyruvate kinase deficiency, the body would have a decreased ability to produce fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, leading to decreased pyruvate kinase activity and the observed symptoms.\n\nThe other options (alanine, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) do not have a direct allosteric inhibitory effect on pyruvate kinase."}

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of chronic kidney disease where the parathyroid glands become autonomous and overproduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to low calcium levels and high phosphate levels. This overproduction of PTH leads to increased bone resorption, resulting in osteoporosis and fractures.\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is also associated with kidney disease but occurs earlier in the disease process, before the kidneys are severely damaged. Elder abuse is a possibility but is less likely given the patient's medical history and the presence of chronic kidney disease. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare inherited disorder characterized by resistance to PTH, which is not relevant to this patient's history.

In CKD, the kidneys are less able to excrete phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia, and less able to produce the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol). This results in hypocalcemia, which in turn stimulates the parathyroid glands to produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH), a condition known as secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism can lead to disturbances in bone metabolism, including osteitis fibrosa cystica, which can result in bone pain and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra seen in the x-ray. The patient's calcium level is on the lower end of normal, which is consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, where you might not see the high calcium levels typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n\nA: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is autonomous production of PTH after a long period of secondary hyperparathyroidism, typically in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, there is no evidence of hypercalcemia, which would suggest tertiary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nC: Elder abuse could potentially cause a fracture, but it would not explain the patient's chronic kidney disease or the biochemical findings.\n\nD: Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a genetic disorder characterized by end-organ resistance to PTH, not relevant to this patient's presentation.\n\nE: Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia due to autonomous overproduction of PTH, which is not the case here as the patient's calcium level is not elevated."}

This is known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. If the diameter of the vessel is reduced by 50%, the radius is reduced by 50% as well. Therefore, the new radius is 0.5 times the original radius.\n\nThe resistance in the new vessel (R2) is (0.5)^4 times the resistance in the original vessel (R1). This is because the radius in the new vessel is 0.5 times the radius in the original vessel.\n\nSo, R2 = R1 * (0.5)^4 = R1 * 0.0625\n\nThis means that the resistance in the new vessel is 0.0625 times the resistance in the original vessel. To find the factor by which the resistance has increased, we divide 1 by this value:\n\nFactor = 1 / 0.0625 = 16\n\nSo, the resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.", "model_b_predict_answer": "The correct answer is D: 4.\n\nThe resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its diameter. This means that if the diameter of a vessel is reduced to half, the resistance to blood flow will increase by the fourth power of 2, or 16 times. Therefore, if the left circumflex artery has a 50% reduction in diameter, the resistance to blood flow will increase by a factor of 16^4, or 4096, which is approximately equal to 4.\n\nSo the resistance to blood flow in the occluded artery is 4 times greater than in a non-occluded artery with the same length and flow rate. This increase in resistance can cause a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to chest pain or discomfort, which is known as angina."}

Recall bias occurs when participants in a study have difficulty remembering past events or experiences, leading to inaccurate or incomplete information. In this case, the study relied on retrospective surveys of mothers to determine their prenatal consumption of folic acid. It is possible that mothers with children diagnosed with ASD may have had a different recollection of their folic acid supplementation compared to mothers with healthy children. This difference in recollection could have led to an overestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and lower rates of ASD in offspring.\n\nThe other types of bias mentioned are less likely to have influenced the results in this specific study:\n\nA: Interviewer bias - This type of bias occurs when the interviewer's behavior or attitude influences the responses of the participants.

The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain, just below the hypothalamus. It is responsible for producing and secreting several hormones that regulate various bodily functions.\n\nThe pituitary gland is composed of two main parts: the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). The anterior pituitary produces and secretes several hormones, including growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL). The posterior pituitary mainly stores and releases two hormones produced in the hypothalamus: oxytocin and vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone, ADH).\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as headaches, blurry vision, and difficulties achieving an erection, are consistent with a pituitary adenoma. The temporal visual field deficit bilaterally suggests compression of the optic chiasm, which is a common finding in pituitary adenomas. The MRI findings of an intrasellar mass further support this diagnosis.\n\nAmong the options provided, thyrotrophs are the most likely cell type to give rise to a pituitary adenoma in this case. Thyrotrophs are the cells in the anterior pituitary that produce and secrete TSH, which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones.

Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?\nA: Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum\nB: Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray\nC: Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies\nD: Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets on echocardiography\nE: Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "A: Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum", "model_a": "PULSE-Pro", "model_b": "HuatuoGPT2", "model_a_predict_answer": "C: Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies\n\nThe clinical features described in the question are consistent with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by a small deletion of genetic material in chromosome 5. The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location known as q11.2. This syndrome is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including heart defects, specific facial features, and learning difficulties.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, small, low-set ears, cleft palate, and a heart defect (single overriding great vessel arising from the heart), are all consistent with DiGeorge syndrome. The systolic ejection murmur heard over the left sternal border is also a common finding in this syndrome.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA: Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum - This is more consistent with hypoparathyroidism, which is a feature of DiGeorge syndrome, but it's not a definitive diagnostic test.\n\nB: Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray - This is a sign of duodenal atresia, which is not typically associated with DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nD: Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets on echocardiography - This is not a typical finding in DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nE: Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination - While ocular abnormalities can occur in DiGeorge syndrome, bilateral cataracts are not a common feature.\n\nTherefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be a chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies, which is the diagnostic test for DiGeorge syndrome.", "model_b_predict_answer": "：根据提供的信息，孩子可能患有第5号染色体微缺失综合征（Microdeletion syndrome 5q）。这种疾病是由于母亲在怀孕期间暴露于某些化学物质或药物而引起的，导致第5号染色体的部分丢失。\n因此，正确的答案是C. 染色体5p删除检测FISH。"}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to a rheumatologist with bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years. The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA: Ankylosing spondylitis\nB: Rheumatoid arthritis\nC: Gout\nD: Osteoarthritis\nE: Fibromyalgia\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Osteoarthritis", "model_a": "HuatuoGPT2", "model_b": "PULSE-Pro", "model_a_predict_answer": "：根据患者的症状描述以及体格检查结果，最可能的诊断是骨关节炎（OaD）。\n骨关节炎是一种慢性疾病，通常会导致关节疼痛、僵硬和肿胀。它也可以导致早晨起床时的关节僵硬感以及其他特征，如手指变细或干燥，喉咙干涩等。在患者的情况下，由于他具有长期的关节疼痛史并存在多个非特异性关节结节，这支持了这种可能性。\n然而，其他潜在的诊断包括类风湿性关节炎（Ra）、强直性脊柱炎（HLA-B27阳性）和纤维肌痛综合症（Fibromyalgia Syndrome）等自身免疫性疾病。这些疾病的症状可能类似于骨关节炎，但它们的特征不同且没有长期存在的关节疼痛史。\n因此，正确的答案是E：纤维肌痛综合症。", "model_b_predict_answer": "D: Osteoarthritis\n\nThe patient's history of being a professional athlete, the presence of joint pain and stiffness, and the physical exam findings of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints and enlarged knees with pain and crepitus on passive range of motion are all consistent with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects the hands, knees, and other weight-bearing joints. It is often associated with aging and previous joint injury, which is consistent with the patient's history as a professional athlete.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (A) typically presents with inflammatory back pain and stiffness, and is less likely given the patient's lack of spinal symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis (B) often presents with symmetric joint involvement and can affect the hands and knees, but it typically causes more systemic symptoms and joint swelling, which the patient does not report. Gout (C) is characterized by acute attacks of joint inflammation, often in the big toe, and is less likely given the patient's chronic symptoms and lack of acute attacks. Fibromyalgia (E) is a chronic pain disorder that affects the muscles and soft tissues, and is less likely given the patient's specific joint symptoms and physical exam findings."}
{"type": "MedQA-USMLE", "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?\nA: Internal carotid artery\nB: Anterior cerebral artery\nC: Middle cerebral artery\nD: Posterior cerebral artery\nE: Basilar artery\nAnswer this question, choose the correct answer, and explain your reasoning process.", "reference_answer": "D: Posterior cerebral artery", "model_a": "HuatuoGPT2", "model_b": "PULSE-Pro", "model_a_predict_answer": "：根据题目描述的症状和检查结果，该患者可能患有基底节性视神经炎或青光眼等疾病。这些疾病的症状包括突然出现的视力变化、头晕以及视野缺损等。\n\n关于血管成像，CT扫描显示没有急性颅内病变，因此选项A、C、D都不正确。而选项B中的前交通动脉是负责供应大脑中后部和侧脑室的血管之一，也是最有可能出现问题的血管之一。因为这种病变可能导致视觉障碍和其他神经系统损伤。\n\n因此，正确的答案是B：前交通动脉。", "model_b_predict_answer": "C: Middle cerebral artery\n\nThe patient's symptoms of sudden vision loss in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, along with dizziness, are indicative of a right homonymous hemianopia. This condition is typically caused by a lesion in the optic radiation, which is supplied by the middle cerebral artery. The middle cerebral artery is responsible for supplying blood to the lateral surface of the brain, including the primary visual cortex and the optic radiation. Therefore, a lesion in the middle cerebral artery would likely cause the symptoms described in this case."}
